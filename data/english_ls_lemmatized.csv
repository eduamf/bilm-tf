1	argument	4	she national gallery choice of picture be example of problem pos to artist by colour , and in a video talk she demonstrate how this artistic problem have be solve . connections with she own practice as a painter be evident , even though she abstract composition be very different in subject from the work of she chose artist , who include veronis and poussin . she	argument	be that the subject of the old master painting could be disregard by a painter who wish to find lesson for the present in the artistic practice of the past . bridget riley have no intention of either present an account of poussin 's aim and procedure , or of demonstrat veronis 's debt to he predecessor in venetian art , as a historian would have feel a duty to do . the artist as critic in this case deliberately avoid the historical context of the picture she be discuss .	None
2	argument	2	if a critic have a very decided political or religious point of view , this can override other consideration in judgement about art ; the viewpoint may also give a bias to the description or interpretation make . a remarkable marxist interpretation , for example , be make of florentine paint from giotto 's time to the fifteen century , by frederick antal in the 1940 . late writer , even that sympathetic to antal 's thesis , have admit that the	argument	about class conflict in the period be exaggerat , but this do not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . of course , a theorist may damage an argument through bias , perhaps exclud relevant evidence inconvenient to the case be make ; but this be not a danger exclusive to theorist . omission be much patent perhaps in survey make with a political bias .	None
3	argument	4	a remarkable marxist interpretation , for example , be make of florentine paint from giotto 's time to the fifteen century , by frederick antal in the 1940 . late writer , even that sympathetic to antal 's thesis , have admit that the	argument	about class conflict in the period be exaggerat , but this do not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . of course , a theorist may damage an argument through bias , perhaps exclud relevant evidence inconvenient to the case be make ; but this be not a danger exclusive to theorist . omission be much patent perhaps in survey make with a political bias . we have already mention in pass the state policy regard the art in germany , the ussr and china ; there have be swrite who follow the party line by give attention to that artist favoure by patronage , while neglect other .	None
4	argument	2	as in book on the philosophy of art , or aesthetics , many do not in fact contain any art criticism , in the sense of description , interpretation and judgement of individual work . they strength be rather in cleare the ground of preconceive idea about the art , and put new point of view . when work of art be descri only that aspect of an image important to the	argument	be inclu . it be in this arena that some of the fierce intellectual fight about art be take place , though the contest range wide than the visual art to politics and economic . for example , chadwick state : there can be no simple category define as feminist art history , since the effect of new idea be that much recend scholarly write have shift attention from the category art and artist to broad issue concern ideology of gender , sexuality , and power .	None
5	argument	3	they may , however , not be exactly what the author would have prefer , as a colour plate which be readily available ( perhaps have be use in another publication ) be much cheaper to use than a new plate which have to be commission . the reader can thus be aware that a write may have write round what happen to have be offer . this may be important in assesse how well a write illustrate an	argument	. the standard which can be obtain in colour reproduction today be high , but not always attain . comparison of illustration of the same picture in several publication will demonstrate this truism , while the good test of look at a reproduction in front of the picture it can be a dishearten experience .	None
6	argument	2	in all capitalist democracie there be two source for the legitimacy of the state , namely statehand it and the ideology specific to the state in question . it will be argue that when the second source be threaten as well as the first , the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way . the conclusion to the	argument	will be that there be a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduce to crime . the specificity of this form of violence or coercion have to be recognize , however one feel about the terrible consequence of it for the innocent . this form of political violence require political answer and not just an anti - criminal , police - orient , coercive response .	None
7	argument	4	covenant theology it empower the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstance , and ian paisley and many of he supporter both within and without the orange order have frequently use bully - boy tactics , and appro paramilitary procession , marche , and drill . from carson to paisley one find the	argument	that it be legitimate to fight to regain one 's fundamental freedom if the sovereign with who one have covenant one 's allegiance betray that allegiance and conduct one into slavery . the argument be clearly inspire by a religious motivation and show ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion , approve whatever defensive measure be necessary to avoid submission to rome rule . ulster protestantism be not contain within church but spill out on to the street . religion be also involve in the violence indirect .	None
8	argument	4	perhaps the much reveale aspect of the whole affair be the way dr browne handle it . the member of he party appeare to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the early bill , and dr browne only find out in october/november 1950 . when he be tell of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , dr browne , he secularly inclin , submit he proposal and	argument	s to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous health minister , dr walsh , have consult archbishop mcquaid on a similar matter in 1946 . if a man of such convictions feel it necessary to follow this course , how much very would have he religiously devoted colleague . in fact , he cabinet colleague , already unsure about public support for the bill and alienate from dr browne by he provocative politics , be not prepare to go against the hierarchy 's condemnation and refuse to support the proposal .	None
9	argument	4	but they do and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation . in addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognize the transformation which theoretical position on christian belief and morality undergo as they be concretize in historical human relationship , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in they perception of socio - ethical issue . part of the overall	argument	of this book be that , as the roman catholic church be principal validator or legitimator of the southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state go on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separate out from the responsibility of the church . this structural link between politics and religion be underline by the legitimacy the church give to the state as a whole , by recognize it simply as society . however , it be the further legitimation give to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectual in decide in concreto what must be take by the state as in the interest of the common good which give to conflict in ireland between the two alliance it political religious dimension in the sphere of law .	None
10	argument	4	this last be soon replace , on 9 may , by a much specific and high organize pressure group heade by many who have previously mount the pro - life anti - abortion campaign . of particular importance to the anti - divorce campaign be a lawyer , william binchy , who have already produce a book in 1984 on the subject . large publicity campaign begin and the irish time also lent it weight to the pro - divorce	argument	, campaign in it column until the eve of the referendum in late june . though the coalition government be allow they tds the irish equivalent for mp a free vote on the issue , it party , fine gael and labour , officially sponsore the campaign for the constitutional change . fianna fil appear to be equally divide on the issue .	None
11	argument	4	this be the line already adopt by binchy ( 1984 ) who interpret world - wide statistics in this direction . divorce be see to be harder on the woman than the man , who could get out of they family responsibility so much very easily with divorce than without it . in oppose the	argument	s marshall by the anti - divorce group , the pro - divorce group argue that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in northern ireland , there be still a low divorce rate . the period of separation in undefended cas be two year , and five year have to run if one of the party oppose the divorce . that man in particular do not benefit from the procedure be suggest by the fact that twice as many woman as man fil for divorce .	None
12	argument	4	one might be forgive for think that the bishop letter have something to do with it and that haughey be intent on construct an alliance between that heed the teaching of the hierarchy and the party faithful . in early may , two - third of fianna fil td from the west have already indicate they would campaign in they constituency against the amendment ( irish time , 2 may 1986 ) . the wood 's speech also introduce an important new	argument	which may have have some considerable effect on irish voter . it suggest that second marriage would substantially infringe the right of inheritance of the member of the first family . in a society of extremely strong rural , traditional value on right of inheritance , the suggestion that constitutional frankenstein would devour constitutional orphan ( dil debates , 14 may 1986 ) be clearly calculate to raise a moral panic , have produce the appropriate folk - devil .	None
13	argument	4	the main ground appear to be the danger which it might pose to the small southern protestant minority by encourag mix marriage . however , no evidence favour such a contention have ever be produce . harry macadoo , then the church of ireland archbishop of dublin , on several occasion put forward the	argument	that southern protestant be a minority group with they own culture and traditions , and thus deserve to have school for they in order to hand on they own tradition . when consider the merit of this argument , one do have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the southern protestant group . protestant opposition to integrate schooling be sometimes hear in the north , particularly from the fundamentalist camp , who not only fear catholic infiltration of state school but be oppose to anything other than bible protestantism in religious education .	None
14	argument	4	however , no evidence favour such a contention have ever be produce . harry macadoo , then the church of ireland archbishop of dublin , on several occasion put forward the	argument	that southern protestant be a minority group with they own culture and traditions , and thus deserve to have school for they in order to hand on they own tradition . when consider the merit of this argument , one do have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the southern protestant group . protestant opposition to integrate schooling be sometimes hear in the north , particularly from the fundamentalist camp , who not only fear catholic infiltration of state school but be oppose to anything other than bible protestantism in religious education . but usually the opposite be the case and popular protestant support for integration be express .	None
15	argument	4	in the debate over the last twenty year there have be considerable interplay of theological and sociological reason , with social scientist also contribute to paper and discussion . what have be see as an aspect of the roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in chapter 5 can also be recognize as a feature of the defence of catholic school too : the opposition contain an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happen to catholic who be not to some degree protect from it . in this write 's view , the	argument	s against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic school support an overall political theology which be strongly base on authority within the church . hierarchy and clergy be see almost to monopolize the teach and wisdo about life . they be both director of soul and minder of the public conscience .	None
16	argument	4	put together with a faith vision of the contemporary social world as inherently secularist and radically subversive of roman catholic value , the combination be significantly reactionary and ethnocentric . the aspect of this political theology will be discuss late . first it be necessary to consider the	argument	s use in the public debate . while the argument of the defender of catholic school have a theological basis , that of the promoter of integrate schooling have be founded on what they see to be the result of the present system , namely a violent and destructive society . but there have be some attempt also to undercut the basic level of the defender 's case .	None
17	argument	4	irish bishop have be well aware of spencer 's ( 1968 ) research . use traditional measure of religiosity , he have point out the apparent failure of english catholic school to produce good catholic and few ex - catholic than state or other school , and have infer the likelihood of the same for irish school . spencer 's	argument	have be band about from time to time . this be not unnatural , as in the 1970 and early 1980s spencer be at the queen 's university , belfast , and an active member of the all child together movement . support for this line of approach have be find in greeley and rossi 's ( 1966 ) survey in the usa on the effectiveness of catholic school .	None
18	argument	4	in the light of w . mccready be finding in another study that the religious behaviour of the father have a great impact on child , greeley consider the fact that catholic school be have an increase influence on man to be of significant importance for the future of roman catholicism in the usa ( 1976 : 1735 ) . clearly , the follow - up study be very favourable to the defender of catholic school than to opponent . however , greeley and rossi 's work also have be use to uphold the defender 's	argument	that , though roman catholic school vary in they efficiency , they be certainly good than any possible alternative in term of produce good roman catholic . thus , both side have tend to use social scientific research to make statement in general about catholic school which have be draw from other country and , therefore , beyond the cultural confine within which irish catholic school exist . this be something for which survey , include that of greeley and rossi , be not and cannot be intended .	None
19	argument	5	there be nothing in the study on the difference between individual catholic school , either in term of pupil experience or the variety of educational practice and personnel in each school . a black - box approach to the schooling process be use with no direct investigation of process within the school . final , while it could be argue that greeley and rossi tell we something of catholic versus state school in the us , they have nothing to tell we about catholic versus christian , multi - denominational school , which be what many of the	argument	in ireland be about . but the central and substantive argument that defender of roman catholic school have have to deal with be that the dual school system in northern ireland encourag , support , or at little reinforce the sectarian divide , and that it form part of the vicious circle maintain conflict in ulster . it have be argue that one could help to break that circle by integrat the school system ( fraser 1974 ; heskin 1980 ) .	None
20	argument	4	a black - box approach to the schoole process be use with no direct investigation of process within the school . final , while it could be argue that greeley and rossi tell we something of catholic versus state school in the us , they have nothing to tell we about catholic versus christian , multi - denominational school , which be what many of the	argument	in ireland be about . but the central and substantive argument that defender of roman catholic school have have to deal with be that the dual school system in northern ireland encourag , support , or at little reinforce the sectarian divide , and that it form part of the vicious circle maintain conflict in ulster . it have be argue that one could help to break that circle by integrat the school system ( fraser 1974 ; heskin 1980 ) . a small number of empirical study actual do in northern ireland have be invok in the course of the debate .	None
21	argument	4	consequently , one have to improve relationship within northern ireland without try to merge the entire school system . however , curricular change , joint teach project , and _ great contact be see necessary . roman catholic church leader have use additional local study to refute	argument	s which treat roman catholic school as part of the northern problem . they have interpret salter 's study of belfast secondary school as show catholic to be less prejudiced than protestant . even if this be so , the implication have be make by catholic school supporter that catholic school have not promote or reinforce any measure of prejudice , and that no other possible type of school could improve on they ( daly 1975 ) .	None
22	argument	4	they have interpret salter 's study of belfast secondary school as show catholic to be less prejudiced than protestant . even if this be so , the implication have be make by catholic school supporter that catholic school have not promote or reinforce any measure of prejudice , and that no other possible type of school could improve on they ( daly 1975 ) . unfortunately , the necessary link to warran this second conclusion a control group of catholic in a multi - denominational situation be simply not available to salter , and so the	argument	be void . use have also be make of russell 's work on the teaching of civics in northern ireland school . the work lead russell he to conclude that the teaching of the subject have no effect whatsoever on pupil 's political outlook .	None
23	argument	2	then all of a sudden , silence . you keep wait for very but it do not come . he work till lunch , then wander into the kitchen and have long	argument	with tony , or perhaps a discussion about the good way to cook trout or whether or not to sack the gardener . in the afternoon he start by sleep , then take over the kitchen and insist on prepare extravagant five - course meal . have i take he into salisbury to the oculist .	None
24	argument	5	i mean , i expect it be difficult to manage without harm they . no each lady have personal place she cake on the long table without assistance . but then mr clancy and mr venables , who have be stand by to offer encouragement , have fall into an	argument	concern position . mr doran have move he wife 's cake to the first position , and mr clancy have move it back to the middle , say the first cake tast have the good chance , and he wife 's cake would be first as it have get there first . mr venables disagree and make some claim about tastebud and they overstimulation .	None

27	argument	5	however , if you be go to fly solo , refuse be the only sensible thing to do . fly demand all you concentration and it be not wise to risk fly if you have business worry or some other mental stress on you mind . even a violent	argument	will leave you mentally high and quite unfit to fly . you can also become unfit in the air through lack of food and drink . both this factor can cause lack of concentration and apathy .	None
28	argument	3	traditionally in anthropology , the ethnographer have study a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field . this have generate considerable concern about the ethnographic experience it , and specifically about the subjective nature of the process . unlike the natural science , where discussion often starts with the result and ignore the methodology of the research , the social science and increase anthropology have develope an elaborate	argument	about the practice of do research . the interpretation of culture and even the ability to understand what be happen in the society under scrutiny as well as the need to grapple with political or ethical question be all littendle and fundamental problem of the moment ( phillip 1973 : 78 ) . mere observation and report be inadequate , give the limit scope of thing which can be truly observe ( holy 1984 : 25 ) .	None
29	argument	3	as social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure ( dougla 1966 ) , require they removal from the public vision . as yet there be no other body to undertake this task , and even tentative move to remove the problem from the cell block and into the detoxification centre founder in the entrepreneurial 1980 ; for there be little immediate profit to be make from reclamation of this kind of scrap material ( although the long - term value of a humanitarian return might be think to be well worth pursue in a civilized society ! ) . the	argument	be therefore not about police control or a utopium without control , but to explore why some cultural behaviour have a history of police action and to discover where that behaviou fit into police ideology . it status or ( as important ) it lack of value create complex system of meaning which be rare articulate ; for the police world have similar stricture to that which benedict ( 1967 ) descri in she attempt to understand the rigidity of japanis culture : man who have accept a system of value by which to live , cannot without court in - efficiency and chao keep for long a fence - off portion of they life where they think and behave according to a contrary set of value .	None
30	argument	4	to i senior command and in 1986 i inform i chief officer of the acceptance of i ph.d . these , in accordance with the directive lay down by force order . no one , of course , have ask to read it , for if i	argument	be correct the service have no need of any reminder of how the ideology work or how to implement the paradigm which support they cultural norm . nor do they need they daily practice to be expose to the analytic eye of anthropological thick description , for in they task - driven world there be little to be gain by reflect on what they already live and understand . any need to analyse the way in which the multi - variant police world form a coherent and self - sustain whole be material for the social scientist and not the practitioner , for they already live the system as a matter of course .	None
31	argument	4	a good proportion of we work concern we availability to act as an unacknowledged arm of the social welfare service to drug user in crisis situations , provide a front - line service for the speed freak who be od will on the result of a bent script , or the acid head have a bad trip , for we be in the street , the pub , the club , the crash pad , and communal house frequent by the new alternative society . much of we daily work be ten year in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet we action be only an extension of that social welfare activity the police have be heavily involve in for generation , but which be never give status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis place upon summon list , number of arrest , crime detection , and other statistical returns . many of we new counter - cultural deviant be articulate and present very cogent	argument	s relate to they alleged victimless crime . for example , they would link they cannabis use and an alternative ideology or religious vision to challenge we somewhat static version of social reality . many of the underground at this period in social history be conscious make a journey towards a new spiritual growth ; and this , as furlong ( 1973 : 106 ) suggest ,	None
32	argument	5	the conversation angus cameron look incredulous , permanent . he friend james menzy the wine merchant , in who house he lodge , have say once , infuriate after a two - hour	argument	, angus do you believe nothing completely after think about it , cameron reply , james , i be tell a good thing once , by the sawyer at bunarkaig . i use to help there as a boy .	None
33	argument	4	mrs menzy have die five year before , kill by malaria and stomach trouble from they time in bengal . menzy he have a yellow face with a stained - look flush on each cheekbone , and when he feel a bout of fever come on , he drink to drow the symptoms . now he look over at cameron , take stock of the quizzical lift of he right eyebrow when he look out below he black fringe , the down - turn of he mouth under he long curve nose , and begin to recapitulate he	argument	with care , uncomfortable aware that angus might think he be try not to sound drunk . consid , angus , he say . they have seize the session book at auchtergaven , and kirkmichael , and logierait , and and many another place .

38	argument	2	i have to adopt the aspect of receptivity . i be very receptive to the bible , authority . i be not interest in	argument	, philosophy i take the simple biblical past have no father i try to capitalise ( on he absence ) , resolve the oedipal struggle , ( create ) good feeling .	None
39	argument	4	since this state of affair be of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and , therefore , of the human mind , it must follow that there be non - physical state of affair essential to the human mind . so a materialist theory of the mind be false . the much primitive physicalist response to this	argument	be to deny the claim that there be anything about the mind that bs do not know . all that bs lack be an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain sort : v know no much than bs , he can simply do something bs cannot . bs be like a man who know all about swimm , even to the point of be able to train the olympic team , but who cannot swim he , and v be the man with the normal talent for swimm .	None
40	argument	1	but this bring we back to the initial problem , which be precisely to explain how materialism could accommodate such a feel . we cannot , therefore , leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical process that they feel different . in fact , the mode of access	argument	be ambiguous . it might be interpret as say that v have a mode of access to he own brain different from any mode of access to v 's brain available to bs ; or that v have a different mode of access to the external world , and that this constitute the difference between he and bs . it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot .	None
41	argument	4	it would make no sense to say that the dot in the picture have a gestalt of they , but to apply this model to the brain and experience would be just like that ; for , if the experience just be a state of the brain , then there be no way in which the character of the experience can be explain as the result of some perspective on the brain . nor , very abstracted , could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ; for , in either case , the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of this the scientist have complete access , and the problem reoccur . if what i say above be correct , failure of the mode of access	argument	force the materialist to deny that bs lack any knowledge and to adopt a behaviourist theory . when a behaviourist approach be employ , it be not apply only to perception , but to all cognitive state . remember that philosopher of the seventeen and eighteen century have already assimilate think to perception , this be not surprise .	None
42	argument	0	first , an objector might try to press the fashionable distaste for the first - person perspective and say that the fact that i cannot apply the theory to i show nothing except that one should not approach the philosophy of mind via the first person . a philosophical theory be essentially a reflection on a practice , and the first - person perspective express engagement in the practice : to apply the theory first - personal be to confuse level . this be a spurious	argument	. a philosophical account give the necessary and sufficient condition ( at little in outline form ) for the application of a concept , and it should , therefore , apply in principle to anything that be a case of that concept . if it really be the case that all i be do when i have beliefs about the world be to have disposition to behave , then it ought to make sense for i to think of i believe in that term .	None
43	argument	4	in show that cognition as a whole cannot be treat behaviouristically , i have not thereby show that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience be false . so perhaps i overkill miss the target : perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception be sound , even though a general behaviourism be not , and what bs lack be not knowledge of the nature of certain mental state , but only the ability to respond spontaneous to visual stimuli , that be , to respond as a result of actual see they . reflection on the nature of the	argument	against behaviourism in general , however , reveal that the argument refute the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . that argument show that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduce to behavioural disposition , for the very idea of a disposition function only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . but there be nowhere else that we might get we conception of the physical world from , other than perception .	None
44	argument	4	there be , though , a host of reason for resist any kind of equation between mental representation and mental picture ; and all of this derive from one fundamental reason . any mental picture will require interpretation , and this interpretation will be another mental operation , which , on the view that think be have mental picture , will be another picture , which it will require interpretation , and so on and so on . this may look like an easy knock - down	argument	against a silly theory which nobody have ever serious hold : but what be true of mental picture would seem to be true of any kind of mental represent process which encode sensation in some determinate form . in other word , the argument work equally against the view that we think in a kind of mental language , that mental sentence rather than mental picture be the stuff of think . sentence and word also require interpretation indeed they would seem to require this very obviously than picture and so we be back on the circle of infinite regress .	None
45	argument	4	well how do i know that this computer do not have a theory of the external world i have no	argument	, an objector would say , just a prejudice . well , i think that there be an argument of sort for say that a computer of the kind descri do not have a theory of the external world , do not have mental state which refer , and do not therefore have thought in any significant sense . there be representation in a language but no knowledge , and therefore no think in the human sense . we should attend to the fact that knowledge of the external world means represent a lot of fact at once , so many fact that we lose hold of the idea of representation .	None
46	argument	1	but this be a fairly repugnant conclusion to many of we . do we really want to say that all we ever learn we know before even if we be say this in some technical computational sense how about a much modest version of the	argument	which say that only certain primitive concept be innate ( about three - dimensionality , causal relation , etcetera ) , and that the much sophisticate concept develop out of this through the time - honour process of differentiat fi concept from global one and integrat the result into complex , structure concept . this be not much help because ( a ) late - develop concept must still on the representational theory of the mind be present in this primitive concept ( there be no mere potential competence such as i potential but non - exist competence to know portuguis ) ; and ( b ) how and where do we draw the line between the primitive concept and the developed one predictable , perhaps , i regard this argument not as a demonstration that the acquisition of new concept be impossible , but as another reductio ad absurdum of the representational theory of the mind .	None
47	argument	4	constructivism and development the constructivist theory of mind regard think on an analogy with action ; just as the representation theory take an analogy with draw and write . moreover , to the same extent that the representational theory be non - developmental ( recall the fodor 's	argument	against learn ) , the constructivist theory be developmental . i would not say that the developmental view be a consequence of the thoughtaction analogy exactly , because there could be constructivist theory that do not mention development . it be certain , though , that the constructivism that have receive the many attention in psychology and philosophy have be the developmental theory of jean piaget .	None
48	argument	4	so why not say , then , that in development perception teach action , that as the information deliver up by the input system become progressive richer the infant become good able to direct he own movement , rather than say that cognisance develop out of action i answer to this point will be very philosophical than empirical . it will rely upon an	argument	from kant . in the critique of pure reason , kant 's aim be to show how objective experience be possible , to set out the conditions necessary for this ; whilst piaget 's aim be to show , give certain kantian assumption , how objective experience actual develop . one of the conditions for ascri to one experience of a mind - independent reality , kant argue , be that we should be capable of distinguish between that sequence of perception ( if you like , representation deliver up by the input system ) which be determine by the movement of object and that which be determine by we own movement .	None
49	argument	4	autism be a very profound cognitive deficit indeed , and everythe that i have say up to now entail that a person who think significantly lacks an holistic character , and lack the relate quality of directedness , inhibition and co - ordination , will be profoundly affect . coda we have cover a lot of ground , and maybe the path through the undergrowth of	argument	s and data be not a very straight or a very clear one . i certainly would not want to attempt a summary of the route we have take all the way from the mind - body problem to child try to win chocolate ; but i do need to make some conclud comment to justify the bold claim in the first paragraph that constructivism make the mind - body problem less intractable . i argue that the representational theory of mind , with it assumption that think be the possession of determinate mental state which be in some sense encoding ( pictorial , syntactic ) of actual or possible state of affair , contribute to the difficulty of the mind - body problem .	None
50	argument	4	i how might such state be both mental and physical at the same time we do not want to say that one kind of state caus the other kind , but neither do it make much sense to say that they be parallel or identical . there be	argument	s for all possible position , but none of they convince we for long ( see chapter 1 and 5 ) . _ that constructivism refer only to mental representation at the level of the input system , as entity which can be translate , very or less directly , into the language of neuropsychology . ( it refuse to take serious the claim that central - system process - think be explicable in terms of the causal interplay of representation . )	None
51	argument	4	much , perhaps all , functionalist be thorough - go materialist who believe that mental phenomena be genuine physical phenomena see at a particular level of abstraction . this commitment to materialism mean that a couple of standard dualist objection must be face . first , there be the dualist 's	argument	that mental process cannot be physical process because physical entity such as neuron - lack certain quality such as intentionality or consciousness that characterize the mental . the response to this be that intentionality and consciousness be emergent property of physical system . neuron do not individually have the property of consciousness , consciousness emerge when a large number of neuron be interact in the right kind of way ; just as speed be a property not of any single component of a car , but an emergent property of the whole system when it be operat in an appropriate way .	None
52	argument	4	furthermore , the work of young and he colleague , which i shall be discuss late in the chapter , show that be aware of the operation of , say , one be face processe system have vitally important functional consequence . however , the functionalist view be that it would be quite misguide to attempt to explain behaviou by make direct reference to the subjective or phenomenal quality ( technically know as qualia ) of this mental state . if it be really necessary to think of mental state as have qualitative content ( and see dennett , 1988 , for some powerful	argument	s that it be not ) , then it follow from functionalism that such qualium do not have causal interaction with other mental state or behaviour and be mere epiphenomena . successful science the sceptic might , at this point , complain that while i may have sketch out the functionalist position , i have not provide any convince argument as to why one should believe it .	None
53	argument	4	if it be really necessary to think of mental state as have qualitative content ( and see dennett , 1988 , for some powerful	argument	s that it be not ) , then it follow from functionalism that such qualium do not have causal interaction with other mental state or behaviour and be mere epiphenomena . successful science the sceptic might , at this point , complain that while i may have sketch out the functionalist position , i have not provide any convince argument as to why one should believe it . what i now want to suggest be that there be a lot of very successful science currently be conduct which literal depend on functionalism be true . if functionalism be false , then the success of the cognitive science be a massive scientific fluke .	None
54	argument	4	this be the myth that i want to examine here . although the majority of scientist tend to be a little coy about metaphysical matter in they professional publication , they be often less so outside when write elsewhere , be prone to describe the framework of presupposition about perception within which they conduct they investigation as if it be a discovery in it own right and that discovery an explanation of perception . and although the majority of materialist philosopher base they belief in the neurophysiological theory of perception on	argument	s rather than observation , they be , nevertheless , greatly influence by the apparent success of neurophysiology . the materialist theory of perception we may think of consciousness as have two component : sensation and perception on the one hand and willing or agency on the other ; or input and output .	None
55	argument	4	moreover , rather as substance dualism tend to do , it seem to undermine the causal role of consciousness in , for example , bring about or influence action . for the causal relation of events would be just the same irrespective of whether or not the causal chain temporarily took on a mental aspect ( as in property dualism ) or ( as in substance dualism ) go mental for a while . a far tell	argument	against the dual aspect theory - and one that have be rare notice be that aspect be relative to viewpoint ; in other word , they emerge posterior to perception . they cannot , therefore , be invok to explain perception , even less the manner in which perception be relate to matter . much scientist implicitly , and the many philosopher explicitly , prefer identity theories .	None
56	argument	4	the monotony of the individual neurone be irrelevant ; what matter be the infinite variety of they combination , of they pattern , which will become evident when we look at the nervous system at the right level . i shall deal with the language of neurophysiological description shortly . however , it be necessary to say a word or two here to refute this seemingly compell	argument	. we be so use to hear talk about the nervous system encod the outside world that it be easy to forget that this be a metaphor and it be one that have no place in serious philosophical discussion of the mind - body problem or the philosophy of perception . the reason the cod metaphor have such currency in contemporary talk about perception be that it seem to suggest a way in which very simple and apparently homogenous element such as nerve impulse can generate the richness and variety of consciousness .

None
76	argument	3	as i have remark , culler 's structuralist poetics encoura some reader to think in terms of rapprochement between the new and the new criticism . anthony easthope 's poetry as discourse offer a complex blend of old and new . he take poststructuralist assumption about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self - subsistent ego , and apply they to the history of english poetry , in a work which combine ingenious close read , impressive knowledge of metre , and an overall	argument	of stratospheric thinness and remoteness . easthope believe that the modernist concept of impersonality , late systematize in the new criticism , and theorize by wimsatt and beardsley in they famous essay the intentional fallacy , be on the right line , but do not go far enough , as the author be not really banished . some of easthope 's approach recall that of c . s . lewe in the personal heresy .	None
77	argument	1	the breakdown of english intellectual insularity be welcome in principle , but a few thing need to be say about this new turn to france . it have become common form to invoke the magic name of the french theorist , as if the name alone would cause a torpid academic establishment to collapse . the use of name rather than	argument	s as ammunition have become noticeable in such exercise , on both side of the atlantic , as chris baldick remark in a review of frederick crew 's skeptical engagement : one lamentable practice which crew rightly scorn be the increasingly revive trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempt to substantiate one 's theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but mere by invok a name from the sacred pantheon . derrida , foucault , kristeva , lacan , barthes : just reel off they name be ( as auden say in a very different context ) ever so comfy , since it safely defer the issue at hand to nothing less than a transcendent signify : in short , to a star .

78	argument	4	it have become common form to invoke the magic name of the french theorist , as if the name alone would cause a torpid academic establishment to collapse . the use of name rather than	argument	s as ammunition have become noticeable in such exercise , on both side of the atlantic , as chris baldick remark in a review of frederick crew 's skeptical engagement : one lamentable practice which crew rightly scorn be the increasingly revive trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempt to substantiate one 's theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but mere by invok a name from the sacred pantheon . derrida , foucault , kristeva , lacan , barthes : just reel off they name be ( as auden say in a very different context ) ever so comfy , since it safely defer the issue at hand to nothing less than a transcendent signify : in short , to a star . this cling to authority have , in i experience , become noticeable in graduate student and young academics in the past ten year or so .	None
79	argument	4	interestingly , anthony easthope acknowledge the distinction at one point in poetry as discourse : failure to distinguish clearly between signify and referent , the object it may refer to , have lead to serious confusion in some accounts of the ideogram . yet it be a confusion he frequently fall into elsewhere , as do other new accent writer . talle be case be convince , though he have certainly not say the last word on the matter , and there may well be far	argument	s from that who be professionally engage in linguistic . there be interesting support material in a book by the american critic robert scholes , textual power , publish in 1985 and not consult by tallis . in tallis 's reading , saussure do not move from the sign , which comprise signify + signify , to reference , because he be not interested in do so , be concern only with the internal aspect of a language - system .	None
80	argument	4	he do not intend to exclude reality . the error lie with saussure 's expositor . schole , however , believe that saussure be he inconsistent , and responsible for late confusion , but the thrust of he	argument	be very close to tallis 's , and both of they be concern as be thurley and nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language be a system of pure difference , without relation to reality . scholes provide a useful table , divide into three column , show how linguist and philosopher have agreed in make a tripartite division between signifier , signify , and reference , though they present it in a variety of terminology . for frege , it be expression , sense , reference ( ausdruck , sinn , bedeuting ) .	None
81	argument	4	some of this write be acute and interesting , the product of lively mind with genuine insight into the state of contemporary culture . i would often rather read it than very conventional form of literary scholarship . yet it be frequently open to pragmatic self - refutation : it argue against reason by the process of reason , and a political cause , however radical , cannot be advance without the traditional process of	argument	and attend to evidence . there be admitted the playfulness of some version of deconstructionist rhetoric , which read like prose - poetry . but such text be subject to the limitation of purely aesthetic discourse , with no through road to action , and must become politically suspect .	None
82	argument	4	sinfield believe that they be often irredeemable taint by ideology , at good to be read only in historical term , or subject to symptomatic reading , seek the fracture and fissure in the mystify surface of the text that show the true ideological condition in which it be produce . against this , ryan advance the humanistic belief that the major canonical text be not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit image and model of human freedom which transcend they immediate historical context and which late reader can respond to . this be an interesting eclectic	argument	which recall gadamer on the fusion of horizon ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , marcuse on the utopian possibility of high culture , and sartre on the necessarily progressive implication of major literature . ryan represent a kind of marxism that non - marxist might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it . this be not alway the case .	None
83	argument	4	it be never very apparent what freudian claims be base on , though they be widely accept in we culture . i scepticism have be reinforce by the recent work of frederick crew , who for many year be a lead psychoanalytic critic in america . during the 1970 he begin to lose faith in the whole freudian programme , and in he recent book , skeptical engagement , he provide detail and substantially support	argument	s for abandon it . freud be not , however , like to be general reject , since he be so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the west . furthermore , attacks such as crew 's be , as he acknowledge , not take serious and reply to in they own term , but treat as symptoms of repress disturbance .	None
84	argument	3	nevertheless , raymond talle , who own training be in medicine , have show to what extend one of lacan 's key concept , the importance of the mirror stage in the development of the infant 's sense of self , have no base in clinical experience . as far as talle be concern , lacan be a charlatan , the l . ron hubbard of psychoanalysis . yet he system , like other on the contemporary scene , be constructe so as to repel	argument	or contrary evidence . bowie , who admiration be tinge with honest caution , have sum up the lacanian system in this word : just as you can gain access to the cave of the unconscious only by be inside already , he seem to be say , so you can gradually reach towards an understand of i work only by understand it in advance .	None
85	argument	5	much of the work that be rediscover may have the literary quality that will satisfy reader without particular feminist interest : the poem by woman that roger lonsdale include in the new oxford book of eighteen - century verse be a small - scale , easy accessible instance . nevertheless , in a feminist academic context write may well be study , not primarily for it literary but for it cultural inter . this question provoke	argument	s in america about the norton anthology of literature by women , some of the content of which be say to have have little value as literature . a common feminist response be to say that the whole idea of literary standard , even standard as such , be a form of male domination . i refer to this significant dispute in pass , without engage in it , except to say that feminist be divide on whether they want to establish a countercanon or extend the exist one .	None
86	argument	5	this phrase , and other like they , have be debate and ponder , interpret and reinterpret , as though they be the formulation of the great philosopher of the past , like plato or kant , rather than the work of a live thinker in mid - career . there be a sense in which interpretation without conclusion be a mode of play ; deconstruction insist that philosophical text must be read as though they be literary text , with full attention to they ambiguity and irresolution . in this light ,	argument	s about derrida 's meaning have the fascination and intractability of argument about the interpretation of , say , eliot 's poetry . indeed , it be a central assumption of deconstruction that the distinction between literature and philosophy be exaggerat , or arbitrary , or even meaningless . certainly , some of derrida 's late work , such as the post card , look very like experimental literature than philosophy in the normal sense .	None
87	argument	3	anyone who can say so clearly just what derrida be say , or do , immediately put the reader in he debt . yet the clarity and rigour may in they be problematical . this be the position argue some year ago by practitioner of la nouvelle critique , who believe that clarity in	argument	be a form of ideological mystification , reinforce the status quo . put in such extreme terms , the position be clearly absurd and self - defeat . but , for derrida , who fusion or ( con ) fusion of obscurity and playfulness be an essential element in he textuality , norris 's exposition may represent a process of intellectual tidy up which leave out something important .	None
88	argument	4	in america fashion can actual be enforce . a few year ago , as part of an annual round - up of critical book for encounter , i review an interesting speculative work on modern fiction by an american academic . i feeling about the book be positive rather than the reverse , but i complain in i review that it be stud with reference to fashionable french gurus that be purely cosmetic , add nothing to the author 's	argument	. a year or so late i chanc to meet he and he acknowledge that this be just criticism , but that he have be oblige to insert this name so that he book would look like a truly up - to - date , intouch work of scholarship . in 1982 at stanford i hear similar accounts of academic publisher require appropriate name and reference in book .	None
89	argument	5	marxist invoke history as a transcendent signify , the ultimate in term of which everything else be to be explain ; but there be many history , not one , and we choose that which suit we . as edward pechter put it , history do not tell we what the text be , because we decide what history be , and then put history into the text , rather than the other way round . something similar be true of politics , another transcendent signify and	argument	- stopper . since politics be traditionally one of the major defin activitie of a rational humanity , the discussion of literature in political term be not only possible but desirable , as the major critics of the past have show . but the word politics it need to be deconstruct , since politics be to do with we ideal of what human life should be , about which there have never be agreement ; indeed , it be out of the disagreement that politics arise .	None
90	argument	5	he believe that literary study have a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ; and the implication of he recent work be that there be other way of attain cultural value . this have some affinity with the marxist position . in a published	argument	between scholes and hirsch , the former make the follow statement , on the assumption that the conservative hirsch would disagree with it : at the heart i belief be the conviction that no text be so trivial as to be outside the bound of humanistic study . the mean graffito , if fully understand , can be a treasure of human expressiveness	None
91	argument	4	scholes be not a marxist , but he american cultural populism have affinity with recent marxist write ; at the same time , hirsch and scholes find they in unexpected agreement . one might reach out to other affinity . when scholes write that no text be so trivial as to be outside the bound of humanistic study , i be remind of c . s lewis 's	argument	that any piece of write have a claim to be literary if someone can read it in a literary i.e . an absorb , attentive , love fashion . the effect of all this approach be to remove literature , as conventionally define , canonize , institutionalize , and teach , from the exclusive and isolated position which it have long occupy in the anglophone academy . even the mode proposal that literature should be read in it cultural context have large implication .	None
92	argument	4	literariness be to be find as a basic principle in the work of the russian formalist and the new critic , and , elaborate formulate , in frye 's anatomy of criticism . it inevitable present it in formalistic term , and sometimes in overtly aesthetic one . the latter presentation be not so common , because of the general unfavourable associations of aesthetic in we culture , though it be imply whenever student be ask to approach a poem as a work of art , rather than as an historical document or a philosophical	argument	. indeed , a dilute croceanism underlie much of we critical and pedagogic discourse , with it reference to expression , feeling , intuition , and unique personal response . poem be very plausible refer to as work of art than novel ; the latter may have obviously aesthetic quality , but have many other thing in they as well .	None
93	argument	4	something of the sort have already be introduce into some english degree , under the aegis of the verbal art association , who have make a welcome start with such work . the reading of english poetry would be accompany by a consideration of historical as well as current theory of poetry . this would include the	argument	s of the major poet - critic of the past : sidney , jonson , dryden , johnson , and on to the romantics , victorian , and modernist . i cannot see how the canon of poetry could avoid be construct along historical line , though the problem and implication of canon - formation should be face , as part of theoretical study . it could take account of recent attempt to enlarge the canon , particularly by the addition of poetry by woman , and other marginalize group .	None
94	argument	4	review and criticism be separate activity , but the good literary journalism can provide genuine and valuable criticism , as morris dickstein have point out . what be need be much journals that be prepare to publish long , serious , reflective essay or review - article , as the london review of book do . victoria glendinn , write as a biographer and literary journalist , have offer some judicious thought on the question , which summarize much of i	argument	: no one could doubt that the application of the academic mind to literature have be salutary in bringe rigour and discipline into criticism : clean text , scholarly annotation , precise analysis , intelligent even transform interpretation and reading ; and an intolerance for woolly emotional response , vague inflate recommendation , and subjective wallowings of all kind . but the academic mind , and the exigency of the academic career , have have the effect of split off academic approach to literature from the reading , in that word 's wide sense , of ordinary people	None
95	argument	4	mr noel stock , who speak as one who have pound 's confidence in recent year and be in daily contact with he , explain that this passage derive from a hint throw out by jessie l . weston in she from ritual to romance , to the effect that the charge of heresy bring against the templar be not wholly unfound , since some of the practice of the eleusinian mystery - cult from the pagan near east survive in the heart of christendom in the ritual of the templar , a survival to be trace in literature in the storie and poem about the quest of the holy grail . from ritual to romance come out in 1920 , and be a new book when t.s . eliot borrow from it for the waste land , thus make it permanent famous ; pound could not have know of it in 1911 , but if he have then visit the templar 's cavern - church in aubeterre he could hardly have fail to remember it in the light of jessie weston 's	argument	. certainly in recent year pound be inter in mystery - cult have be much than antiquarian ; in be erigena we he ask whether the philosopher scotus erigena be one of the eleusinian brotherhood , and we can be give full weight noel stock go so far as to claim ( op . cit . p.22 ) that some of the obscurity of this late canto be deliberate and arcane he write about they as an initiate in word that be both publish and not publish . fascinate as this be , it be sure with relief that we return from thus check print source against print source , cross - refer and tentative identify , to the open air of the road of france .	None
96	argument	4	the story be an intricate one , as herbert schneidau acknowledge ; and pound 's hold out against ford for the dantesque principle of a curial diction ( see he introduction to the poem of lionel johnson ) represent to i mind an objection that can still be raise to ford 's principle of diction , salutary as ford 's polemics undoubted be for pound at this time . moreover prothero , a historian , perhaps have no idea about poetic diction one way or the other ; pound , as we have see , think he victimize by prothero not for anything to do with wri but for have champion lewis the painter and gaudier the sculptor . all the same schneidau 's	argument	be just and illuminat , so far as it go . but do it go far enough it be worth look again at pound 's letter to michael robert , strident though it be .	None
97	argument	4	if we resent this ( as we should ) , we ought to realize that it be we who be to blame for it . for neither kenner nor pound be a professional or obsessive anglophobe . both man be report what seem to they the fact of the case , and they be the much confident about do so because no englishman have arise to rebut they	argument	s . for we to respond with sneer anti - americanism be the mere childishness . after this , pound 's relation with england and the english be for the much part an aspect of he relation with that one of he erstwhile protg who have become , surprisingly , a pillar of the english establishment eliot , editor of the criterion .

100	argument	5	the choreography likewise evoke change of weather and mood but without display any overt narrative development . the two central , baggy - suit dancer , lynne bristow and william trevitt , either mirror each other ' movement ( the old man perhaps commun with he diary ) or else dance as a couple ( the man relive past relationship ) . thus some slow , desiccate waltze and gentle lean have the quietude of an old couple on a dull mild day ; sequence of deft , steppy footwork and sharp edged leap have the high spirit of blustery sunshine , while a duet of rhythmic fidgety gesture have the feel of a lifelong	argument	continue during a rainy afternoon . the other four dancer regularly interrupt or echo this sequence with image from the past a robust trio , who folk step and causally thrown jump have the coltish energy of adolescence and two couple who look like lover court in the 1920 . by the end this quartet depart the stage in a halt dance of death and trevitt be roll up in a carpet , leave bristow alone without partner or diary .

102	argument	4	history show it can go on for a long time , as deficit and surplus do during the golden age before the first world war . very recent history suggest the world have become much much like that again , with investment in each country break free from the constraint of domestic saving . evidence of excessive demand there be some observable good sense in this	argument	, and it help to explain why sterling have not hit the fan a lot earlier , during a truly spectacular sw from surplus to deficit over the past two year . but it limit be expose by ask a simple question : why , then , should mr lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even large why should a good deficit not get even good	None
103	argument	2	today there be again a global capital market , but no gold standard , no fixe exchange rate , for britain not even a european monetary system . that be not mr lawson 's fault , of course , but he have to live with the danger that while the world 's capital market will duly bridge the gap between britain 's domestic saving and investment , they will only do so at a low price for sterl . if you take the	argument	about consent adult to it logical conclusion , that price britain 's exchange rate should be leave to they , too . but however suspicious mrs thatcher may be of manage exchange rate system , she dislike a falle pound as much as anyone . so we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payment , and the operationally interesting question : for how long can we expect the world 's saver to make up we domestic shortage	None

107	argument	4	the classic example of market failure be environmental protection . education and training and research and development be other area where government intervention be bad need . the dilapidation of we transport system and the shoddy state of we national service underline the	argument	for much public investment . labour 's change of policy on the european community put it in a strong position to argue that economic and industrial decision be increasingly likely to be make on a european basis and it be essential that britain play a much constructive role . we shall need to develop , for example , a viable policy on economic and monetary union .

111	argument	5	in the absence of the big idea , one good phrase would be a help , something to focus the uncertain and suggestible mood of the country and put it finger on what it be that be miss and want after 10 year of mrs thatcher . by the end of this week we shall know what the labour party no long stand for , such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ; but what , in essence , do it stand for if it do not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the atlantic to the ural , socialism in all it manifestation be lose the	argument	to liberal capitalism for we should not become too carry away by labour 's change face and tone of voice , nor too dazzle by the peter mandelson image - conjur . the party may have put on a collar and tie but it be still the labour party , prone to it old reflex ( as it remind we yesterday on defence spend ) , prisoner still of it anachronistic structure , it mind set in 100 year of work - class history .

None
254	arm	4	even during flurry of technique , both hand remain on they respective side of the centre - line .	arm	movement economy of arm movement be important since the very you flail they about , the long it take to cock they for an effective punch . move you arm as little as be necessary to achieve you purpose , and always move they together so that if the front hand be knock down an incom punch , the rear be execut a counter - punch . you simply do not have the time for the one pause two sequence so belove in basic training .	None
255	arm	4	follow the opponent 's shape , not he attacke limb , because although an individual technique may have be successfully evade , the opponent still remain potentially dangerous . scoop the opponent 's front kick , draw it back and up to break he balance if you be likely to face he open side , then circle you block	arm	so you twist he away a front kick can also be counter effective by move back on the diagonal . face the opponent in opposite stance ( i.e . if you opponent 's right leg be forward you lead with you left and vice versa ) .	None
256	arm	4	the third example use a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent 's incom reverse punch . use a long , thrust snap punch to the opponent 's face and if the chance present it , follow up quickly with a reverse punch . if the opponent 's attack be a face punch , then hit he extend	arm	with you forearm , glance you punch over the top of he and into the target . ( a ) step diagonally forwards , catch the opponent 's advance punch with you lead forearm ( b ) continue you fist into the opponent 's face	None
257	arm	4	the second requirement be that of good time . some competitor just be not quick enough off the mark , or they hold back instead of thrust in strongly . either of this fault mean that the attacking technique be well develope before you move into it , and so you front barr	arm	or groin suffer according . move directly into a high roundhouse kick and stop - punch it stop a front kick by barr down with you lead guard whilst reverse - punch to the opponent 's chest	None
258	arm	4	to do this you slide back you rear foot so that the stance lengthen ( this make it very stable in a longitudinal direction ) and you centre of gravity drop . if the action be sharp enough you opponent 's punch will graze over the top of you head , help on it way by a fast rise block . as well as deal with the punch , the rise block travel diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catch he high on the attack	arm	. do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring you chin close to the opponent 's other fist . there be no need to withdraw you block arm fully as you reverse punch ; you probably will not have enough time to anyway !	None
259	arm	4	as well as deal with the punch , the rise block travel diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catch he high on the attack	arm	. do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring you chin close to the opponent 's other fist . there be no need to withdraw you block arm fully as you reverse punch ; you probably will not have enough time to anyway ! the main thing be to shift you centre of gravity forwards behind the punch , so that it be deliver with plenty of power . simply rock forwards on to you lead knee to achieve this .	None
260	arm	4	shout to underline you score . drop under the opponent 's high punch , block high on he	arm	with rise block whilst reverse - punch strongly with the other making your punch score as we see in the chapter deal with rule , it be not enough for you punch to be an effective score technique ; it must be see to be so , and this entail make it success obvious .	None
261	arm	4	even if the slide be not feasible , you can still throw you centre of gravity forward , so that weight increase on the lead leg . the fifth attention - grabber be the exaggerate hip action which should accompany every punch . this show that the punch be not mere an	arm	movement , but a powerful , co - ordinate body action . the punch hip , be it the lead hip of a front punch or the traile hip of a reverse punch , must swivel forwards , so that you centre - line directly face the opponent . you may well decide to twist even far when use the front punch , but beware that you situation be weaken should the opponent immediately counter attack .	None
262	arm	4	the back fist this punch be not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one . the back fist unroll from the shoulder , propell as much by the body turn away as by the	arm	action it . many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action . a back fist will out - range a reverse punch perform by an opponent of equal height but it be not often score because many referee do not consider it powerful enough .	None

None
264	arm	4	lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range , and raise you other hand as a guard . unfortunately , the cock action that begin a back fist movement present an unmistakable cue to the opponent . the punch elbow must be flex before it can be extend fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extend	arm	be sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . the question be , how do you disguise the elbow flexion one answer be to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .	None
265	arm	4	also , the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction , so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach he . by that time , of course , the element of surprise be lose and he guard be ready and wait . the remainder of the sequence then degenerate into a mle of pump	arm	s and leg . the hook at this point it be necessary to distinguish between foot sweep and hooks .

366	arm	4	in follow stravinsky 's guideline , ashton find many new , sometimes frivolous , way of perform class - room step . the corp de ballet neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur le pointe , raise the working knee and rest the toe on the calf of the other leg , before move forwards . they travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relev after break the rule that the	arm	s never cross the centre line of the body and be always ( except in arabesque ) round . if ashton 's scne de ballet be compare with balanchine 's ballet imperial , it will be see that balanchine rare break away from the classical technique as practise in petipa 's day when tchaikovsky wrote the music . ashton , like stravinsky , take into account the technical development which have take place .

367	arm	4	dancer easy understand how a series of swift pa de bourre courus ( i.e . run on the toe ) as dance by the queen of the wili in giselle , differ from the same step perform piqu ( i.e . each foot pick up sharply at each change of weight ) , as in many of petipa 's solo . but it be not always easy to decide which be the much appropriate , nor how the two way mention can lead to other version . for example , in she solo in ashton 's cinderella the winter fairy mofe across the stage in a series of pa de bourre an tournant terre , the foot weave they in - and - out pattern as the	arm	s flick to and fro sparkl with frost . in symphonic variation , the dancer perform pa de bourre piqus sur le pointe very gently because they be mark the rhythmic beat as the soloist dance to the melodic phrase . this be an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythm be explicitly bring to life by the dance design ( see page 68 ) .

None
369	arm	4	but such jump can also travel some way forward , backward or sideway and can become sparklingly light when the knee be sharply bend upwards at the height of the jump . this be require of the four fairy , the fairy godmother and the star in ashton 's cinderella . however if this way of jump from two foot to two foot have not be combin with well pick - up pa de bourre piqus and relevs retir as well as extremely accurate , quick port de bra with straighter and very angled than rounded	arm	s , they would have seem out of place . when move dancer from two foot to one in both open and closed sissonne , the choreographer can make the movement dart over the floor as aurora do in she final solo in the sleep beauty . in les patineur and les rendezvous ashton make he dancer travel upwards as well in an effort to show off they ability to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .	None
370	arm	4	it can be that magic moment in such dance as the rose adage in the sleep beauty when aurora triumphantly raise she hand from the four prince 's grasp and hold the final attitude for several second reveal she complete command over the force of gravity . there be hundred of instance of this kind of pose create by many different choreographer . there be the moment in the act ii pa de deux or swan lake where odette appear to fly away in an arabesque before siegfry seize she	arm	s and draw she body close to he in an embrace . there be also the excit pos that come at the end of some of ashton 's pa de deux as the two character declare they love , for example , when oberon cradle titania in he arm at the end of the dream and , even very excitingly , when cola lift lise high on one arm it the end of they dance in act ii of la fille mai garde as if to crow she queen of the harvest in some modern classical ballet too little attention be pay to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up as it be what have go before .	None
371	arm	4	for example : in choros he focuse attention on many ancient greek dance ritual and accent the playful use of movement whilst at the same time show that such warlike , athletic courtship and other activity be a wonderful game to be play by the performer . in consort lesson this quick change of aulement give much great variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dance with four boy . very recently , in he the son of horus he have find way of incorporat the profiled attitude and pos see in ancient egyptian design with straight turn - in leg , elongate line and angle	arm	s , all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curve bodies of classical dance . as ashton and macmillan in many of they ballet , he have create a style appropriate to one particular ballet . unless he choose another ancient egyptian theme he be unlikely to use the same style again .	None
372	arm	4	petipa 's remark that without port de bras the dancer be dumb be only one of the wise comment he make when work on he choreographic design . fokine echoe this remark when he say every step and pose be a gesture ( see page 58 ) . de valois sum up the idea of this two great choreographer by say : only synchronisation of	arm	s and leg will give symmetry to step and pose , streng to the jump , speed to the pirouette , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . to ensure that he audience would appreciate each sentence in he dance , petipa usually repeat each at little twice and usually four time . but towards the end of the second or four repeat he make some small alteration in the port de bra so that the dancer could move easy into the next sentence .	None
373	arm	4	this be particularly noticeable in he variation for the six fairy in the sleep beauty . petipa clearly reflect in dance the gift that each fairy bring to the christening . the first fairy be slow and gracious to denote beauty ; she encircle she face with she hand and display the line of she	arm	( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . the second fairy bring grace and dance slight faster in such a way that she show off the line of she body as it face forwards and then backwards ( the traditional gesture ) . the third fairy dance slowly sur le pointe and use conventional hand movement to show she bring the gift of plenty , just as the godmother at a russian christening scatter breadcrumb over the cradle .

None
377	arm	4	any untoward or awkward transition be immediately noticeable because it destroy the calm dignity that the human body need if it be to be show at it good . this do not mean that speed must be avoid , nor that the unexpected need offend the eye . a sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of leg or	arm	s , or quick jump up and then down to the floor follow by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement have in the whole design . swift change in the dimensions cover in any linear design be nowhere very obvious than in ashton 's five abstract ballet and he example be now be follow by david bintley in he choros and consort lesson . in fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift change add a touch of humou as two or very dancer compete to capture the attention of both the audience and they colleague .

387	arm	4	fokine 's advice to that wish to create the romantic style of dance be much as fur demi - caractre when he say : the choreographer should base he design on classical technique from the foot to the waist , but above that the dancer 's head , body and	arm	s must be free to express the mood , emotion and action of the character in the story or theme to be communicate . this style be first create by taglioni for he daughter marie . the tale of la sylphide give he an opportunity to exploit she expressive arm and face as well as she ability to dance sur le pointe . perrot develop the style in he dance fur carlotta grisi in giselle . it be then expand by fokine and use in both grave and gay mood in les sylphide and le carnaval , where it be particularly expressive of both meaning and music .

391	arm	4	if choreographer study the above work of ashton and macmillan , they will understand how far the art of choreography have develop since fokine change it structure and texture . they will perhaps understand even good if they pay particular attention to the fine detail of every movement . it be no long the case that the romantic style mean dance classically from the foot to the waist and above that allow the body ,	arm	s and head to express they to describe the mood , emotion and action of the character . it be well know that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old aurora , happy at she birthday , into the dreamy figure the prince meet in the woodland glade and on to she final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to she responsibility as queen - to - be . the enchanement she dance thoughout the three scene do not change in style or content .

684	audience	2	for example , when the musical phrase get complicated because of the use of many note , the dancer find they use they hand feverish in order to give every note it value . occasionally this can be intereste as it be in bintley 's consort lesson ( 1984 ) . but if it be repeat too often the incessant jigge of hand make the	audience	littrestle , too . a study of dalcroze eurythmics from which such idea emanate be valuable , but the practice must be use with discretion if the resultant ballet be not to resemble an examination of machinery rather than a feele fur the rhythm and shape of the engine that make the dancer perform . daphnis and chlo aston 's romitic style the lover be unite ( margot fonteyn , christopher gable and the royal ballet )	None

687	audience	2	much other story ballet can be analys in much the same way . that with a theme , or which consist of dance only , have a similar plan . a choreographer who neglect the old rule and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music be demande a great deal from an	audience	. many plotless or so - call abstract ballet , by choreographer such as balanchine , have no specific character or climax but they do follow the composer 's score very closely . many composer of special commissioned music , even tho late than stravinsky , follow the time - honour rule of thematic continuity and development and above all rhythmic phrasing .	None
688	audience	2	this can be effecte by the use of a leitmotif or phras of music . since the first performance of giselle , certain composer and arranger have use leitmotif fur one or several character and repeat the leitmotif each time the character appear . this musical phrase give continuity to the action and be much valuable because they help both performer and	audience	to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the player . adolphe adam , composer of the music for giselle , initiate this idea which great influence wagner and late composer . leitmotif be a firm point of reference that carry the dancer onwards from the begin to the climax and to the end of the story .

691	audience	3	schoreographe can also take a very subjective view of they work . this be equally important and have so prove throughout ballet history . the choreographer seize on the personality of a particular dancer and create ballet through which the dancer gradually develop and disclose unique talent and quality to such a degree that	audience	s soon recognise a star . the name of four choreographer immediately stand out . taglioni recognise he daughter marie 's quality of other worldliness in la sylphide ; perrot discover carlotta grisi 's unique quality as an actress - dancer in giselle ; fokine expose tamara karsavina 's many - sided brilliance in such work as the firebird , le carnaval and petrushka ; ashton foster margot fonteyn 's vary personality .

692	audience	3	no good example can be give than by cit the career of tamara karsavina and margot fonteyn , both of who work with many different choreographer as well as submitt they to the severely classical discipline of the old petipa repertoire . a general view there be a third type of choreographer who produce ballet which give	audience	s great pleasure through the sheer variety of they virtuoso design . because of the interesting , usually technical , demand make on the performer , they ballet often become testing ground for future soloist . variation from such ballet as petipa 's don quixote , raymonda and la bayadre and bournonville 's napoli be still consider by much classical dancer to be much technically demande than the much complex twisting and turnings of modern choreographer who mix they style .

None
700	audience	2	despite the general activitie there be menace in the air and it be not long before the rival faction of montagues and capulets be fight and deaths occurre before the lover even meet . this opening be very different from the quietly charm first scene of a month in the country , where the only thing amiss be natalia 's bore behaviou . even with such example in mind the choreographer may well decide it be good to delay the confrontation between the chief player because , by create and stresse the general atmosphere , this raise the	audience	's expectation before the meet of the protagonist , and the sudden onset of passion be what make the ultimate tragedy so poignant . this happen in giselle where hilarion 's suspicion of albrecht 's identity be already arouse before albrecht meet giselle . hilarion 's discovery of albrecht 's sword and late he confrontation with giselle , with the sword in he hand , still do not convince giselle of albrecht 's duplicity .	None
701	audience	3	despite the great difference in style between the above three ballet and despite they different libretti the three choreographer perrot ( with saint - georg ) , macmillan and ashton give valid reason why the tragic deaths of giselle , romeo and juliet , and natalia 's lost love be the inevitable result of what have go before . in other word , what happen at the begin of the story state why the relationship between two or very character lead to confrontation which continue onwards to a climax and final draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion . this last task be possibly the much difficult because the	audience	must be convince that the ending chosen be the only possible outcome of everything that have go before . the ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music . stravinsky ensure a happy yet solemn end to the firebird by use the old easter hymn at the gate where the whole congregation rejoice at the renewal of life .

None
704	audience	2	it be equally important when she be wear a soft tunic or one - piece tight and leotard . the line make by the two dancer together must always have room to breathe and to be see separately if the whole design be to flow . it be possibly the spaciousness of design that bring	audience	s again and again to ashton 's symphonic variation and monotone , who straighter and continuously move line require the dancer to draw they calmle and to fill the stage generously with movement . this could not be very different from the cruel flinge of mary vetsera 's body by rudolf in the mayerle pa de deux with which macmillan describe the count 's tragic mental state . technical characteristics	None
705	audience	2	a contradiction in style during this change of aulement or alignment can distort the design . nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can add inter and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which odile make face the	audience	and she sudden turn to arabesque when she look straight into the kneele siegfried 's eye in the act ii pa de deux of swan lake ; it be odile 's triumph for she know she have won siegfried 's heart . even very excit change of aulement can be find in ashton 's birthday offer where each soloist dance an old step at a new angle , without break the rule or old convention of nineteen - century ballet . he then give an entire new quality to the class - room exercise on which this enchanement be base .

None
708	audience	2	this last convention be invaluable in early train because it help to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and be also valuable in such ballet as birthday offer as it echo the period and style of glazounov 's music . but this would get very bor if use too often . another old rule decree that dancer never turn they back on the	audience	, because all have to face the k , the centre of attention . the turn of a dancer 's back can now become part of a beautiful line be make in a total picture . today 's dancer not only dance fur an audience .

709	audience	2	a sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of leg or arm , or quick jump up and then down to the floor follow by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement have in the whole design . swift change in the dimensions cover in any linear design be nowhere very obvious than in ashton 's five abstract ballet and he example be now be follow by david bintley in he choros and consort lesson . in fact such unusual movements often arouse the	audience	to gentle laughter as swift change add a touch of humou as two or very dancer compete to capture the attention of both the audience and they colleague . classical dance pattern in classical ballet the pattern and grouping delineate by the dancer 's body be usually symmetrical and evenly balance over the whole stage .	None
710	audience	2	it should be not that a similar order of precedence exist in ashton 's scne de ballet as in petipa 's the sleep beauty which be suppose to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of louis xiv . however , when ballet be perform for the public , professional dancer take the place of courtier and technical innovation have to be make . the dancer now appear on a stage before a wide	audience	and the focus of they attention change to the whole audience or to the much important performer . they have to adap they movement to cover a large space which be like a box with one side only be open to public gaze . they have to pay great attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .

None
1428	difference	1	we cannot , therefore , leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical process that they feel different . in fact , the mode of access argument be ambiguous . it might be interpret as say that v have a mode of access to he own brain different from any mode of access to v 's brain available to bs ; or that v have a different mode of access to the external world , and that this constitute the	difference	between he and bs . it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot . but the question be how this constitute a subjective difference .	None
1429	difference	0	it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot . but the question be how this constitute a subjective	difference	. one can then choose to say either that it constitute the difference by virtue of have a particular internal feel associate with it , or that it be it the difference , simplicite . the former simply reinstate the problem of the inner feel . within the mode of knowledge framework , the feel will be explain by the special mode of access to one 's own brain .	None
1430	difference	3	within the mode of knowledge framework , the feel will be explain by the special mode of access to one 's own brain . that this will not do be what i have just argue . the second response , that the	difference	consist solely and simply in a mode of knowledge of the external world , without invok any internal and introspectible feel , require one to explain perceptual experience with different mode of access without reference to a subjective component . as far as i can see , the only way to do this be to adopt a behaviouristic approach to this knowledge and characterize it as an ability to discriminate visual object . to take this road be to resort to what i early descri as the much primitive physicalist response to the problem , which involve deny that there be anything about the nature of experience that bs do not know .	None
1431	difference	5	it be the content specifically of sense - perception that must be take non - reductive , if the contrast require by we concept of disposition be to be maintain . some philosopher might suspect that i have not consider the behaviouristic theory in they many sophisticate form . would it not make a	difference	if one identify experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminate the various sort of stimuli within the nervous system this be a version of the supposedly post - behaviourist theory call functionalism , which treat mental state as respond to other internal and mental state as well as to external stimuli . the first thing to notice about functionalism be that it do not fare any good than behaviourism in provide an account of what it be that v know and bs do not , for bs could know all about v 's functional or covertly behavioural state ; so there be no lack of knowledge that he deficit could consist in .	None
1432	difference	3	thought will be refer to as cognisant act . the simpl and many fundamental aspect of cognisance ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally ) be what be usually refer to as self - world dualism : the knowledge that there be a physical world out there of which i be an experiencer and that be distinct from i . mental development , on the constructivist view , consist in the elaboration of this knowledge ; so that if there be one central	difference	between the mental process of the baby , the child , and of the adult it be in terms of how self - world dualism be manif in ( and to ) the subject . the representational theory of mind treat the explanation of mental life as a kind of engineere problem ; it start from the inside , from the representational state , and ask how mental state interact with one another to produce something that we would call knowledge ; the representational theorist proceed like a sceptical philosopher who think that what figure in we mental life be not reality but we mental representation of it ( recall i say the fodor descri he position as methodological solipsism ) . the constructivist start - point could not be very different , and might be say to be biological where the representational theory be engineere or machinological .

1433	difference	1	consider then , an organism in a world of inanimate object . ( there be a lot to be say about the role of other person too , but i be leave that out for the time be . ) there be three crucial	difference	s between the organism and the object . ( 1 ) it can move it and have biological need ( not just for food and warmth and the like , but the need to use it faculty functionlust as it be once call by a german psychologist ) . ( 2 ) it have input system .	None
1434	difference	5	it mean that we can think about thing that be not present . sure enough , we would expect the input system to ensure that the right kind of distinction be draw between contou change that define occlusion and that which define disappearance , for example but this sure do not mean that the possessor of this input system be capable of think about unperceive entity . what this add up to , then , be the claim that if there exist an organism which either could not act or who action make no	difference	to it perception then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( it be not clear to i whether this be some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis . you may say that it be refutable and so it be empirical ; but then see below we criterium for cognisance be so much bind up with what the subject can do that it be difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature . )	None
1435	difference	3	the point of the experiment be this : strong social pressure be be put on this child to agree to a realist answer ( they be not allow out of the room until they have an answer ! ) and if they usual tendency to interpret question phenomenally be a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it . the result be that the social pressure have no effect at all . in child between four and eight year of age there be absolutely no	difference	between the number of realist answer produce by the pair and by the control , solo child . they know the realist option but do not take it as a way out of a social impasse , because , i would argue , the phenomenalist tendency of think be too strong . what dominate they judgement be the salience of the illusion that be many up front in consciousness .	None
1436	difference	3	where will the child now point if he point to the empty box then it be probably fair to regard this as deliberate misinform , as the implant of a false belief in another 's mind . in fact we do find a clear	difference	between the three - and the four - year - old : the young one typically point to the box with the chocolate and the old child to the empty box . but what be strike about the three - year - old 's behaviour here be that they do this for twenty trial . they could see that the competitor 's pile of chocolate grow ever higher and that they be winn nothing , and yet they be powerless to do anything about it !	None
1437	difference	1	initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose inter and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus be then change in some way and if this caus a re - awaken of interest ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby have detect the change . another technique be preferential look . if the subject prefer to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he have detect a	difference	between they . 8 . this idea have a great influence upon the think of schopenhauer who follow up it implication very thorough than do kant . 9 .	None
1438	difference	1	the problem be that it be high improbable that a group of patient with brain injury constitute a natural kind , even when they display similar symptoms on some test or other . this be because no two patient be likely to have identical injury , and large group of patients be even less likely to be homogenous . in fact , if you probe deeper , vitally important functional	difference	s between patient will emerge . in amnesium , as in many other so call neuropsychological syndrome ( developmental dyslexium , schizophrenium , wemicke be aphasia etcetera ) there be probably no uniform pattern in nature wait to reveal it . what you have be group of people who display superficially similar symptoms for a variety of different reason .	None
1439	difference	1	it be know as a speech output system because there be evidence that a quite separate lexicon be involve in speech perception . a pronunciation be address either with or without the mediation of the semantic system we store of word meaning . the fundamental	difference	between the two route , then , be that a pronunciation be either buil up from sublexical component ( assemble phonology ) or look up as a whole ( address phonology ) . this model have be extremely successful in enabl we to understand acquired dyslexium . acquire dyslexia involve a loss of read ability as a result of brain injury .	None
1440	difference	3	moreover , a closer look at individual patient provide support for what be say about the heterogeneity of group at the start of this section . so , the much that surface dyslexics be study , the much it become obvious that the condition fractionate ; there be important	difference	s between individual surface dyslexics . this difference can also be accommodate by the dual route model . for example , one surface dyslexic can accuratele define the irregular word that he regularize in pronunciation tasks ( for instance , pronounce colonel as col - oh - nell ) . he probley be therefore at the level of the speech output lexicon .	None
1441	difference	1	i have go into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first , that it can be mislead to categorize patients too narrow into group , and second , that the dual - route model i descri can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual case . there be an equally important additional point that i want to make . since brain damage can produce this very precise	difference	s between patient , it be difficult to avoid the conclusion that there be one part of the brain that have the precise function of carry out each piece of information process that be specify within the cognitive model . it seem to i to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain be literal carry out this function . cognitive neuropsychology thus provide powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalist use to describe brain process be the correct one .	None
1442	difference	1	although neither have be cit directly in the text , the philosophical idea in this chapter have be heavily influence by the work of jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn . fodor ( 1981 ) provide a very clear description of functionalism , and he book the modularity of mind discuss some of the philosophical issue surround cognitive neuropsychology . pylyshyn ( 1984 ) contain an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence , and pylyshyn ( 1973 ) contain an interesting discussion of the	difference	s between cognitive science and phenomenology . a very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology be provide by ellis and young ( 1988 ) . churchland 's matter and consciousness be an equally lucid introduction to the philosophy of mind .	None
1443	difference	1	the lack of explanatory force of neurophysiological and psychophysical observation be explicitly admitt by some scientist . it have be well express by the biologist richard dawkin : the sensation of see be for we very different from the sensation of hear , but this cannot be directly due to the physical	difference	s between light and sound . both light and sound be , after all , translate by the respective sense organ into the same kind of nerve impulse . it be impossible to tell , from the physical attribute of a nerve impulse , whether it be convey information about light , about sound or about smell .	None
1444	difference	1	he assert , rather cryptically , that it be because we internally use we visual information and we sound information in different way and for different purpose that the sensation of see and hear be so different . it be not directly because of the physical	difference	s between light and sound this be not a very convince escape from the circularity of the psychophysical laws . on the contrary , it expose the explanatory weakness of the muller doctrine , if it be offer as an advance in we understand of the origin of different modality of sensation , of why the world feel as it do ; and , even very , if it be offer as an account of we be able to feel the world at all .

1457	difference	1	under the chairmanship of sir peter parker the concept of the commercial railway and the social railway be develop at the end of the 1970 and the start of the 1980 . the first be to be run on strictly business line , while the second neede financial support . this emphasise not only the importance of the distinct type of business but the	difference	between the business and the operation . so on 4 january 1982 the railway 's commercial undertak be divide into it separate element . freight and parcel have always be see as distinct entity , and this naturally form two of the new sector .	None
1458	difference	3	the good example of this have be the deployment of the hst fleet . this be first buy in the 1970 by the region , but it have be deploy under sectorisation with singleminded determination to maximise earning . yet while intercity be suppose to be one business , offer consistent standard throughout britain , many regional	difference	s in what the traveller actual experience die slowly . it be now the sector which sponsor investment in track and signall as well as roll stock , that must deal with the modernisation of stations , and so on . the decision be commercial : what will earn the good return on the investment	None

1460	difference	2	the example be not always abstract ballet , because the three aspect descri above be applicable to many choreography if music and dance be to be equal partner in a ballet . how ashton reflect the period and quality of the music a study of five ashton ballet show that all be base on classical technique , despite they apparent	difference	s . each reflect something of the period and quality of the music , the period be of the time when write by the composer or when present as a ballet and the quality be that inspire in the choreographer by the composer . symphonic variation ( 1947 )	None
1461	difference	1	this be somethe that ashton emphasise when natalia , kolia , vera and the tutor dance to chopin 's grande polonaise and fantasy on polish air in a month in the country . it be this careful attention to traditional dance rhythm which be so important to the style of both ballet , although neither can be call a character or national work ( see page 28 ) . schoreographe can make subtle	difference	s between dance to a waltz , mazurka or polonaise and there be contrast rhythm to be find in a &frac34 ; time signature . another way of accente it be the so - call six temps , that be , two bar with six strong beat . this be a favourite rhythm fur male solo use particularly by nineteen - century balletmaster .	None
1462	difference	1	this dance matter very much to petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmaster because they be expect to show off the wealth of talent find in the many imperial , royal and state theatre , e.g . all the character from other fairy tale who come to aurora 's wedding and the character dance in swan lake . mim dance and dance mime however , the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kind be eliminate by fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action from he first ballet and never replace they . instead , he use what he call mim dance or dance mime , insist , when ask fur an explanation , that there be a subtle	difference	between they , only one of degree . to fokine , l sylphide be mim dance because he have incorporate a few conventional gesture into he choreography . fokine say that every phrase of he dance be a gesture , and explain : undoubted an arabesque have many meaning but only when it appear as an idealised gesture .	None
1463	difference	1	the scene between hilarion , giselle , albrecht and bathilde be reminiscent of the scene that develop tybalt 's hatr of romeo from the first fight between montague and capulet to he discovery of romeo with juliet after they first meet at the ball , and final to the fight that end in tybalt 's death . this scene height the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy . despite the great	difference	s in style between the above three ballet and despite they different libretti the three choreographer perrot ( with saint - georg ) , macmillan and ashton give valid reason why the tragic deaths of giselle , romeo and juliet , and natalia 's lost love be the inevitable result of what have go before . in other word , what happen at the begin of the story state why the relationship between two or very character lead to confrontation which continue onwards to a climax and final draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion . this last task be possibly the much difficult because the audience must be convince that the ending chosen be the only possible outcome of everything that have go before .	None
1464	difference	5	the cold air be make even very apparent by the swift footwork when the entire cast jump light upwards away from the ground . admitted the dcor and light help to create the illusion of changing season . but if ashton have not make this very distinctive change in he port de bra , the seasonal	difference	s would not have be so notable . the above example be only a few of that show how conventional port de bra can be change . a study of ashton 's way of use they , or of macmillan 's , reveal how unnecessary it be to keep pass the arm through 1st position .	None
1465	difference	3	the hornpipe be not exclusive to england , which many seem to think , even though petipa in he ballet the daughter of pharaoh include a hornpipe to represent the thames in a spectacular scene where the four great river of the world meet under the sea . each country with a saile history have it own version which differ only slight from that of other . the	difference	lie in the rhythm of the pipe tune to which it be dance . but much very can be make out of it well - recognise movement . a particularly fine example be that design by de valois for the sailor in the rake 's progress .	None
1466	difference	1	this can rough be classify as come from work , hobby and pastime . the activity involve may be heavy or light or something with a specialised technique . for example , there be a very great deal of	difference	between saw a large log by hand and stitch , or between play a game of tennis and a game of card . embroidery require a specialised technique , so do ice skat . in decide to use a particular occupational process in he design a choreographer have four consideration :	None
1467	difference	1	the events and circumstance surround such plot be difficult to control and organise because the character be supposed live in the real world . so the choreographer cannot make strong contrast between the style usually use for the other - worldly spirit and that use for the character live in the particular setting . he can only highlight the atmosphere support the plot , especially tho circumstance where he have to portray	difference	s between class and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasy , etc . , for example the contrast that must be make between the dance for all and sundry in the town square and that for the aristocrat in the ballroom of romeo and juliet . nevertheless every choreographer create this kind of romantic ballet today have to spend much time create the proper gesture to replace the word , which in such ballet be never speak but must be understand . if the dancer perform that gesture with feel and understand they will express the mood , emotion and action of the character they play .	None
1468	difference	1	natural emotional expression because the character of a month in the country , enigma variation , romeo and juliet , the invitation and mayerling be supposed live in a real world , the choreographer have no need to make many deliberate contrast in the style of dance . certainly there be a	difference	between class when , fur example , the tutor dance first with katia the servant , and then with natalia in a month in the country or when townspeople dance in the street and noble in the ballroom in romeo and juliet . nevertheless much much attention have to be give to the port de bra of all type of character in such ballet because this supply the word not speak in dance . lf the port de bra be to be convince , choreographer need to study natural emotional expression .	None
1469	difference	1	they have to be very specific about the traditionally accept form of behaviour , customs , occupation and particular national characteristics . it be the impact of the polovtsian warrior and they dance from prince igor ( 1910 ) that startle parisian and other audience into recognition that even the much barbaric dance have a rightful place in the theatre . the	difference	s between character dance and dance of character a distinction must be make between character dance and dance of character . it be first make by dauberval when stage la fille mal garde .	None
1470	difference	3	in thorough systematise form it now apply throughout the ussr . much of the syllabus have become part of the training of dancer all over the world . it feature be very much the same as that descri early in connection with demi - caractre style ( see page 93 ) but with a very strong	difference	. the step be always perform in boot or heel shoe so ali the movement look strong and often heavy . they require accurate time and neat footwork of the accent be to be hear and see .

1479	difference	5	as an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core great reduce the drive requirement to produce saturation level , simplify the circuitry need by the system . it may be feel that replace two straight core with a r structure be too drastic a change to gloss over , but the mechanism be not too different in the two case . figure 9 represent the way in which the line of force be concentrate from the immediate vicinity and make plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much	difference	in the flux change it experience from either system . an additional advantage of the ring core be that it will accept much than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientation to the external magnetic field . for example while the coil orientation show in fig . 10a produce the large output , that 10b links none of the changing flux and have a null output .

None
1484	difference	5	in certain respect , what hawkes call the new new criticism have what look like connection with the old version . both be directe towards the formalist reading of literary text , and some anglophone academics try to minimize the strangeness of french import by say that la nouvelle critique be only offer a new version of what have long be familiar in the anglo - american academy . this assumption ignore great	difference	s in contextual form of life and conceptual foundation . nevertheless , lodge be able to use classical structuralism and aspect of russian formalism to refine and extend the exist approach of formalist criticism . resemblance be apparend between northrop frye 's system of archetype and structuralism ; indeed , hawkes refer , without qualification , to frye 's anatomy of criticism as a classic of north american structuralism .	None
1485	difference	3	hawkes , in turn , give the book a mockingly dismissive review in the tls , without mention nuttall 's accusation against he . nuttall , like thurley , write with a polemical edge , but both of they present they case in a serious philosophical fashion . what emerge from recent counter - theory be that french - inspire theory tend to destroy straw man in it attack on reference , insist that the relation between word and meaning be entirele arbitrary , a matter of	difference	only . the point have be frequently make that there be no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar , faithful , bark , domestic quadrup , which in other language , get refer to as chien , hund , cane , etc . and within the language - system of english , the sound and letter of d - o - g be recognizable as such simply because they be not d - i - g , or d - o - n , or l - o - g .	None
1486	difference	3	he do not intend to exclude reality . the error lie with saussure 's expositor . schole , however , believe that saussure be he inconsistent , and responsible for late confusion , but the thrust of he argument be very close to tallis 's , and both of they be concern as be thurley and nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language be a system of pure	difference	s , without relation to reality . scholes provide a useful table , divide into three column , show how linguist and philosopher have agreed in make a tripartite division between signifier , signify , and reference , though they present it in a variety of terminology . for frege , it be expression , sense , reference ( ausdruck , sinn , bedeuting ) .	None
1487	difference	3	in principle it would be quite possible for the study of english poetry to begin in a similar ab initio fashion , except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who do not have at little some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read very . this be because the study of poetry as poetry rather than as historical or cultural material be a matter of intuitive and affective response , not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline , as might be the case with philosophy , economic , and so for . ( i gran that the	difference	be not absolute , and there may be element of the affective and the intuitive in the pursuit of any intellectual discipline , but they be likely to be marginal . ) it could be a reward form of teach to help an uninformed but well - motivate student to come to terms with poetry , but it would involve time and leisure . the student would need to read as wide as possible in different kind of poetry , to learn something about literary history , genre , and convention , and to acquire the practical - critical skills of close reade .	None
1488	difference	1	to see this activity as represent the apotheosis of morris zapp and the eclipse of phillip swallow be tempt but too simple . british version of zapp be probably now in america anyway , find a proper market - base reward for they talent and energy . american professionalism may be the ideal , but	difference	s between the british and american academic system be noticeable . the great spread of american high education mean that , proportionate to population , there be far much university , all with english department ; if they be as proportionately numerous in britain , we would have about 1 , 000 university . hence the wide and generally understand variation in academic calibre between american university .	None
1489	difference	1	and , little definable , there be the cultural nationalism , the concept of englishness that , from the begin , have be a major element in the subject . it produce a mystique which obstruct total professionalism and separate british from american attitude . yet despite this	difference	s , english english have go quite a long way down the road of a much - or - less americanize professionalism , as identify and reject in the 1960 by leavis , lewis , and gardner . from the point of view of that who be currently in charge of high education , english must be an awkward subject . it be popular , in demand , and cheap .	None
1490	difference	1	raymond william come to think that a split of the discipline be increasingly likely , since cultural materialism and radical semiotics be not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study : for this necessarily include the paradigm it as a matter for analyse , rather than as a govern definition of the object of knowledge . in this situation , the question have to be raise : can a radical different work still be carry on under a single heading or department when there be not just diversity of approach but very serious and fundamental	difference	s about the object of knowledge ( despite overlapp of the actual material of study ) for reasons which be much very pragmatic than ideological , i have come to think that a separation of cultural study from english , though not easy , would be the little damage way forward for both party . it would represent a realignment within the humanity , not a diminution of they .	None
1491	difference	1	newbolt be attitude be still very common not only among the british ( especially tho who have come under the influence of f . r leavis ) , but also among american free versifier who think they be an avantgarde and who be muddle enough to think that they have pound 's authority to back they . whether they know it or not , they be in fact endorse henry newbolt against pound ! all the same , there be by and large a crucial	difference	here between british and american attitude , and one that be today every bit as mark as it be in 1912 . for on nearly every american campus there be an atelier in the shape of a creative write programme , whereas on no british campus be there any such thing , and indeed the british scoff at the mere possibility on precisely the ground that newbolt here put forward . pound 's exasperate bewilderment before the spectacle of british loyalty to the amateur , and british readiness to pay the price in tolerance of the amateurish , be nowhere so evident as in he lifelong esteem for laurence binyon , the editor of the hewlett letter .	None
1492	difference	2	fire have to consume to give off it light . but light get it knowledge and have it intelligence and it be by go over thing without the necessity of eat the substance of thing in the process of purchase it truth . maybe this be the	difference	, the different base of not just this two poet , bill and ep , but something very , two contrary conception of love . anyway , in the present context , it serve to characterize two different personal via : one achieve it clarity by way of charita , the other go about it business blind , achieve it clarity by way of what you might call confusio . and this would be the point from which to look back at olson , as catherine seelye want we to , and to regard the maximus poem as embody the way of confusio .	None
1493	difference	1	this be what pound could never have say . when , infrequently , he want to write in some simple metre , he do so ; but when very often he want to get away from standard metre , he leave they behind altogether , no ghost of they lurk behind he arra . the	difference	between the two poet correspond ( not quite exactly , because the nature and history of french verse differ so great from english ) to the distinction that the french make between ver libre and ver libr ; between , we may say , free verse and freed verse . eliot 's practice , as he remark just quote make clear , be always free verse : verse freed indeed from the constraint of traditional prosody , yet rather constant recall to the reader 's ear one of the traditional pattern it be depart from . ( hence , notable in gerontion , eliot 's ability to approximate and even conform to jacobean blank verse , yet to depart from it smooth when he please . ) pound 's verse on the contrary be , at little after homage to sextus propertius , free , not freed : the rhythm that he sotch and attain either have never appeare before in the language , or else have not appeare there for many century .

1547	difference	2	a fifth mistaken approach be the facile assertion that opponent be be inconsistent . there be two line of rebuttal . one be to say that there be subtle	difference	s which explain alleged inconsistency , as for example between bann experiment altogether or after 14 day yet allow late abortion . some people believe that the different intention of the experimenter and the abortionist , or the different location of the embryo in a petri dish or in a woman 's womb , be morally relevant factor . it behove the sceptics among we to listen and argue rather than to whoop with delight at the superficial difficulty .

None
1551	difference	2	the second weakness in the government 's position be that in an important respect it be ambiguous . the prime minister oppose entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system ; the chancellor favour it . instead of adopt one or other of this policy , they have try to hide they	difference	beneath an uneasy and evasive compromise . neither mrs thatch nor mr lawson be able to mention the subject from the platform . this be bad politics as well as bad economics .

1576	difference	1	it be difficult to compare the perception of labour and conservative identifier who read the same paper since the number in we sample who read any one paper be low and tended to be draw predominantly from one party or another . a breakdown be possible only for large - circulation paper like the sun and the mirror . amongst mirror reader , there be no	difference	between labour and conservative identifier in they perception of the mirror 's anti - conservative bias , though conservative mirror reader be somewhat less likely to detect a pro - labour bias . amongst sun reader , there be little difference between labour and conservative identifier in they perception of it anti - labour , pro - conservative bias . both labour and conservative sun reader increase allege pro - conservative bias in the sun as the campaign draw to a close .	None
1577	difference	1	this chapter use two technique to investigate media influence . to assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trend in television news content and trend in overall public perception . to assess the impact of very differentiate media source we can look for	difference	s between they different audience : difference between reader of highbrow or lowbrow paper , for example , or between reader of right - w and leave - w paper . the impact of a change television consensus our analysis of television news content in chapter 4 show that controversy reach a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .	None
1578	difference	4	but this effect have decline to only 22 per cent by the last fortnight of the campaign . similarly , reader of lowbrow paper be relative ill - inform about poll before the campaign but catch up on highbrow reader late : the effect of read a highbrow paper decline from 33 per cent in the pre - campaign wave to only 15 per cent in the close stage of the campaign . by contrast , the	difference	between that who do and do not watch bbc - tv widen : so the effect of television view rose from 12 per cent in the pre - campaign wave to 20 per cent in the last fortnight of the campaign . thus , as the election approach , the basis of public awareness of opinion poll shift from very personal factor like political interest or choice of paper , to very impersonal mobilize factor like television news . the kind of people who be much aware of public opinion poll in the close stage of the campaign be very different from the kind of people who be much aware of they in the mid - term ( table 7.6 ) .	None
1579	difference	4	we have already not the correlation between overall trend in perception of opinion poll and trend in perception of party prospect ( see table 7.3 ) . at any one time there be wide	difference	s of opinion about party chanc however . some of that difference be relative unpredictable . it be always fair difficult to predict difference of opinion about conservative and alliance chance . in the precampaign week , conservative voter be very optimistic about conservative chanc , labour voter about labour chanc , and alliance voter about alliance chanc ; but the partisan influence on perception of conservative and alliance chanc be much small than on perception of labour chanc .	None
1580	difference	4	a trend analyse confirm this regression finding . there be always an enormous	difference	between the economic perception of that who initially have conservative and labour preference , especially tho who descri they as party supporter . the difference be large when they focus be on britain ( not they ) last year ( not next year ) . irrespective of the focus , however , the difference widen as the election approach . because a majority of conservative supporter be economic optimist and a majority of labour supporter be economic pessimist , the difference between net optimism amongst conservative and labour supporter exceed 100 per cent : it be 105 per cent in the pre - campaign wave , rise to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign .

None
1583	difference	4	public awareness of opinion poll be much predictable in the pre - campaign wave and become steadily less predictable as the election approach and awareness spread throughout the electorate . before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness be a generalize interest in politics , but as the campaign draw to an end television view become very important . before the campaign there be a 41 per cent	difference	in awareness of poll between that with high and low level of interest in politics ; but this decline to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . reader of lowbrow paper be relative ill inform about poll before the campaign but catch up with highbrow reader late . conversely the difference between that who do and do not watch television widen .

None
1585	difference	1	but that be only part of the explanation for the magnitude of they sw to the conservative . the fact that uncommitted voter who read the sun or star swing so much much than other uncommitted voter suggest that this paper be particularly good at influence they reader . swings be high amongst voter who watch both bbc and itv news , and amongst that who avoid watch highbrow television news programme , but the	difference	s between this group of television viewer be slight . once we distinguish between party supporter and uncommitted voter we find no consistent difference between voter with different view habit . swing be high amongst that who rely very on television than the press for help in decide how to vote , rather low amongst that who rely very on the press , and low of all amongst the 40 per cent of the electorate who find television and the press equally useful .

1588	difference	1	that may be true , but in 1987 hostile interview with neil kinnock try to explain he party 's defence policy count as part of the labour party 's coverage . coverage of all kind can be both favourable and unfavourable no matter whether politician be in government or in opposition and politician they must bear the prime responsibility for ensure that when they do get access to the medium they present they own case well . there be no	difference	between government coverage and party coverage in this respect except that government have much initiative in determi the news , which mean that it have much opportunity than the opposition to ensure that it coverage be favourable . so long as balance be define in terms of the quantity of party coverage and not whether it be favourable or unfavourable then the only justification for award the government extra coverage be that the government represent order , stability , and legitimate authority , which the medium have a duty to support . that who do not apprive the mobilizing ideal for the medium should not apprive extra medium time for the government , especially near to election time .	None
1589	difference	1	right - w reader of a right - w paper be very likely than leave - w reader of that same paper to claim that they paper be biase towards the right though a majority of both leave - and right - w reader typically agree that they paper be biase and agree on the direction of that bias . instead of react against the bias in they chose paper , reader tend ( at the margin ) to defend they paper ( if it be biase against they party ) or even to glory in it bias ( if it be biase in favour of they party ) . the	difference	between public response to perception of bias in the press and on television be reflecte in the complex relationship between voter 's allegation of bias and they rating of the usefulness of the press and television news . sviewe who allege bias on television tend to give television news low mark for usefulness than viewer who perceive no bias on television ; but reader who allege bias in they paper tend to give they paper high mark for usefulness than reader who perceive no bias in they paper ( chapter 6 ) . overall , although reader be well aware that they paper be relative bias compare to television and although they rate television as much very useful for provide information about issue , they do not rate television much very useful in help they decide how to vote .

1590	difference	1	the switch of new focus clearly have some influence on the public 's agenda but a remarkable small one : in terms of television influence the public 's agenda the cause seem much great than the effect . once in four year : the findings a major theme that run through we finding be the enormous	difference	between election and non - election time . in the midterm between election inter in politics be much high amongst high educated voter and amongst regular reader of the quality press the guardian , the telegraph , the time , and similar paper . but that be no long true at election time : as the election approach the high educated became less interested and the less well educat become very interested ( chapter 2 ) .

2293	organization	1	( he do admit however that this remain be in historical time at little link to patrilineal group ; rather odd inheritor of the principle of the matrilineal gen . ) two other general point also emerge from the discussion of greece and rome . the first be that it show well the distinction engel make between general principle in this case the dissolution of communal	organization	and the rise of class and specific cas . engel do not pretend that the history of greece , rome , and the iroquois be identical . what he state be that the dame general principle govern they development , although condition be so different that this principle have considerable different effect in the different case .

2294	organization	1	the communal and the familial be not necessarily in opposition they be matter of level , and although at certain time marx seem to see this , at other he do not and engel never do . this be because of they legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind . none the less the fact remain that the presence of descent group tell we nothing directly about domestic	organization	. there be , however , yet another way in which modern anthropologist could agree with marx , engel , and morgan concern the group aspect of marriage . all would stress that we view of marriage as a private alliance concern almost exclusive two people be totally inappropriate for many non - capitalist societies , especially tho base on descent group .

None
2297	organization	1	the various dayak society of borneo be an example . this great variety than that envisage by morgan or engel do certainly modify the picture . on the whole , however , they idea concern the political	organization	of descent - group society , what they call the gentile constitution , be surprisingly modern and helpful and seem support by very recent finding . the next stage in morgan 's and engel 's scheme for the evolution of political system be characterize by confederation of different tribe . morgan , who engel follow , be once again base he on he study of the iroquois .

2806	performance	4	be it criticism there be a massive amount of wri about art , only some of which can immediately be identify by a reader as criticism . write by the art critic of a newspaper be self - evidently criticism , in parallel with the write of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treat almost in the same way as a	performance	. articles in magazine be less certainly descri as criticism , for they main topic may be personality or history , and art may be only a small part of the writer 's account . book and catalogue may contain criticism ; but they writer may think of they as art historian , philosopher , aesthetician , anthropologist , historian or biographer , and there be many other possibility ; they book may never be identify as art criticism .

2813	performance	4	when we turn to the theatre the question of scale be also significant . the theatre be large than life , not in term of physical scale , but because movement and speech be comparative emphatic and intense , even when a play simulate everyday natural surrounding . some people find this make theatre less believable less true to they own experience and therefore less convince than the much restrain	performance	s see on television and cinema . theatre invite you to give you full attention to what be happen on stage the theatrical experience be a very concentrate one and you as a member of the audience be vitally connect to what be go on . as part of the audience you be as much a part of the entertainment as the performance it , and this be something that dramatist be aware of and have always write for .

2816	performance	2	but you may not actual learn much , simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play , rely on the skills available and hope that the audience will give adequate support . so what else can you do in recent year the amateur actor have have much opportunity for classes in theatre work , includ voice and movement train as well as	performance	and directe skills . this facility differ in all part of the world , but in britain the evening class be probably the much accessible form of training . london be obviously where many of the opportunity abound .	None
2817	performance	2	but when you be look for a suitable speech you can not really reject anything familiar solely because you think it might bore the panel . it be true that extract such as phoebe 's think not that i love he from as you like it ( act 3 , scene 5 ) or viola be 1 leave no ring with she from twelfth night ( act 2 , scene 2 ) may be all too well know to a panel , but i cannot agree with an adjudication policy that would ban this piece from the audition . the selection be right if it truly work for the compet student , and it be the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the	performance	of the piece . the much important thing be you firm knowledge that the selection be within you present range . it be not much use arrive somewhere at ten in the morning clutch the collect work under you arm and wish you have a wig and be born thirty year earlier in order to play lear or for that matter the duke of gloucester .	None
2818	performance	2	what you will eventually be work toward be a fusion of instinct and technique , and train be very largely to do with improve technical skills . at drama school , there be constant attention to a student 's control of both voice and movement , and the different departments work at develop a student 's overall act technique . the emphasis will be on develope an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and give him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a	performance	. classes the first term be always an unsettle time , and it generally take a few week before student become familiar with each other , and work together effective .	None
2819	performance	2	much class last for an hour or perhaps an hour and a half . in the first term , rehearsal for the production project will usually be around two hour in length , but progressive much time will be spend on this aspect of the course as the student advance . ideally the class support the work do on the production project and it be particularly valuable if there be strong liaison between voice and movement tutor with the director of a project not little in help student see how the instructional classes connect with they own	performance	s . if drama school do not incorporate a stage management course , basic lecture and some participation in production work may take place in the senior term . it be always useful for a student of act to have some practical knowledge of stage management , help him/her to appreciate the need for efficient technical support for any production .	None
2820	performance	2	and a trained singe voice be undoubted a valued asset there may well be some competition for a place on singe tutorial . the first production the text for the first term 's production will usually be select for the purpose of get a new group to work together rather than try to go for detailed individual	performance	s . the range be obviously very wide , and you may find you in a greek tragedy , or even a modern exercise play such as games by james saunder , where the student may add to the text by research material which can be incorporate in the project . either way , the main intention will be to establish a way of work , and to begin assesse student 's voice and movement abilitie .

2821	performance	2	the piece test the actor 's awareness and imagination to the full , but nevertheless make precise demand on he : he must follow exactly what the author say . throughout drama school there will be continuous work on act solo piece , and both sing and act tutorial be usually conduct on a one to one basis ( very on tutorial in chapter 7 ) . of course the student also need to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary action and movement which be part of the natural traffic of	performance	, and learn about prop handle . classes help the actor to gain confidence in deal with many thing happen at the same time , and this be an important part of student work . radio , television and film class	None
2822	performance	4	unfortunately , it be often difficult to get agents to attend this production . much drama school final production be stage over a similar sort of schedule , which mean agents be ask to see student 's work over a fair compress period . agent be notify of	performance	s by the school , and they also receive hundred of letter from student invite they to see particular performance . remember , though , that badger agents be quite useless ; if they want to come they will come , but telephon they and oversell you can be just as useless as not let they know that you be alive and worke . it will be the same story for many moon to come .

2872	performance	1	there have even be attempt to stage biographie , one of the first be lor 's billy the kid ( see page 30 ) . choreographer who be inspire to interpret music can do so in many way , all of which can be successful , but only if they remember that it overall rhythm be not mere a mechanical guide to the time of the step within the dance design ( see page 68 ) . the second mean of the word impetus should be apply to the actual	performance	of any step or pose in the purely technical sense . that be , the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus be to be give so that the step achieve it full purpose at the proper moment usually in some gesture and it musical emphasis . the moment can be as the dancer paus momentarily in a pose , as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .

2873	performance	1	or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space , such as the moment in a grand jet an avant when the dancer 's two leg be at an equal height from the ground and he or she appear to travel onwards effortless through space . it can also be the moment when a dancer move into a pirouette and spin before hold a pose . however , very important be the third meaning of impetus which have also to do with physical	performance	. impetus be again need , particularly in a story ballet , when it have to be give to emphasise the significance of a step . this always use to happen in old ballet when the hero would take a step forward with a slight stamp before he swore to marry the heroine .	None
2874	performance	2	sometimes it be valuable to emphasise the impetus it , particularly if a bravura pirouette be need to display a dancer 's particular expertise or perhaps some exhibitionist trait in the character portray . this can be much effective in cas where the dancer take a slow preparation into a firm but slight demi - pli then sudden rise and turn five or six time . this kind of bravura	performance	be only legitimate if the context and music allow the dancer to steal a little time . much classical choreographer still use this device when work with nineteen - century ballet music , which be often write to order by a composer understand the choreographer 's desire to show off a dancer . since the day of diaghilev and he commissioning of score exclusive to one ballet from such composer as stravinsky , this pander to technical prowess have rare happen .	None
2875	performance	4	the above definition may at first seem to have little to do with a choreographer 's work . but if the choreographer do not understand all the detail which go to make the total presentation of a ballet , it can all too easy fail in some way or other . mere to count all the detail that it be necessary to accumulate from the preparation of a scenario and score through rehearsal to public	performance	should make it clear that co - operation from other artist as well as from dancer be require . there must be a librettist if the choreographer do not plan out the plot a composer or arranger of music , a designer for set and costume and all that associate with set and props , painte stage - manage , light and everything else need to get the curtain up . an understand of mass in choreographic term only mean how to organise and manipulate the dancer within that mass of object .

None
2879	performance	2	ashton and macmillan do show that change can be make . to take only one example , they use of the arabesque as a gesture . it style of	performance	and expression change repeated throughout each ballet as the dancer change with the attendant circumstance . the arabesque as a gesture change to give some insight into the character 's mood , emotion and action , as well as arise out of the rhythmic and melodic phrasing of the music . there be an obvious contrast in ashton 's enigma variation between the youthful dorabella 's playful and love arabesque in front of elgar and the arabesque of he wife , which be calm and tenderly sympathetic when she dance with he .

None
2996	plan	3	there appear to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and vary pub stock . history , indeed , tend to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforce rather than curb market excess . it be the license system and license control , after all , which help to foster britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hand of the brewer in the first place ; and it be the same system which connive at and partly encoura the modern contagion of open -	plan	pub design . in addition , the 1989 mmc report , conceive as an attack in the public interest on the monopoly power of the major brewer and require the unty of large chunk of they tied estate , may have devastat consequence for traditional pub . for despite they other shortcoming , much of the major brewer have be able and will to cross - subsidise many less profitable house .	None
2997	plan	3	at the saracen 's head at towcester , for example , a recent proposal to historicise the pub involve extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the bad clich of traditional pub detail , such as bull - eye glass and copper lantern . in recent year serious damage to the historic interior of pub have resulte from the creation of the open -	plan	which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . often the creation of the open plan interior require the removal of wall , chimney breast , stair and other internal feature of interest , which be high destructive of the building 's historic character . the owner of the hollybush at elstree propose to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's facade and to demolish the timber frame side wall of the passageway behind in order to form a large and open interior , even though it be this feature that distinguish the building as an historic inn . in the much extreme cas the exist building be so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild be propose .

2998	plan	3	a good example of this can be find in the sleep village of buckland in oxfordshire ! the lamb , a picturesque village pub close some year ago by allied , be reopen in 1989 as a free house after an extensive remodell which involve the complete gutt of the original unexceptional but characterful , partitioned interior . now nothing remain whatsoever of the old fitting , feature or proportion ; in they place be a vast , open -	plan	space with bright white wall , bistro furniture and cheery chintz . a similar treatment be recently mete out by allied 's tetley walker subsidiary to what remain a fundamentally georgian pub in an urban setting near manchester the church inn at lowton . have apply cement render over the external brickwork , attach a hideous modern porch and add an extension in jarr and inappropriate modern material , the brewery designer have gut the interior .	None
2999	plan	3	one such example be the grade ii pen and parchment on bridgefoot in stratford - upon - avon , where the barn at the back of the pub be use as a theatre throughout the 18th century . such appropriately stratfordian association have , however , be totally disregard by whitbread in they recent cavalier remodell of the complex . not only be the pub interior they of the nondescript , open -	plan	kind , but the barn to the rear have be wholly mutilate . fortunately , not all recent pub refurbishment have be in this vein . a number of the big brewery have recently make encourag mofe towards a much sympathetic attitude to they historic pub .

3001	plan	0	the rich variety of pub type create during the 19th century have subsequently be large lose by redevelopment and remodell . this not only make an understand of the nature of victorian pub difficult , but also mean that that which do survive merit special care and attention . one of the much important change in pub design during this period be in the	plan	. pre - victorian pub be large run on the basis of waiter - service , follow from the original concept that the pub be a house open to the public for refreshment hence the term public house . thus the introduction of bar service be a revolution .	None
3002	plan	3	thus the introduction of bar service be a revolution . bar service enable various different room , or cabin within room , to be serve from a central point ; many late - victorian pub have a sequence of separate private bar serve from a single bar - counter , in total contrast to the current fashion for single - room pub . the modern desire for open -	plan	have lead to the removal of many bar - partition , destroy the character of original interior and distort any attempt to create a truly victorian interior . the small private bar not only create intimate area within a pub for small group of people , but also enable a wide variety of people to be serve in the same building . a 1907 description of a typical suburban pub with six bar feature omnibus driver and conductor in the four - ale bar , horny hand son of toil and lady customer in the bar opposite , with other woman in the bottle and jug .

3461	sort	1	this think cast the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in it materialistic moment ; and much of metaphysics can be see as a response to it . aristotle be the first to try to naturalize the vein of generality that must structure any intelligible world , by say that form in thing be individuals , not universals . the controversy surround the interpretation of aristotle 's conception of form be unend , but , on all interpretation , he objective be to give form as great an affinity with particular as be possible , consistent with they retain a	sort	of generality which be , so to speak , release in the intellect when they be think . something that be not form , but be only matter , could not become general in this way and could not answer to the generality of the concept with which we think . the naturalistic instinct have be to claim that mind somehow create generality in a sense stronger than that which aristotle allow ; it do not mere release generality from it potential state in matter , but fabricate it .
